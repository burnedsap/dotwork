            <p>When I look up at the sky, I might see an airplane or two, but apart from a few rare sightings, the sky
                seems relatively empty. However, a quick glance at a (pre-COVID) flight schedule says anything but. Our
                skies are quite literally filled with airplanes, especially in a city with an airport. However, this
                data is quite difficult to visualise, let alone see even. Taking data from <a
                    href="https://opensky-network.org" target="_blank">opensky-network.org</a> <span>↗</span>, I created
                a Sky
                Globe which allows you to see the airplanes in the skies above your location.</p>

            <p>Sky Globe takes your location, and visualises the aircraft flying above you in real time. It shows all
                aircraft within an area of 295km around your location. Airplanes do fly awfully quickly, and a wider
                catchment area allows us to see aircraft that might be passing on the periphery of your location. The
                sketch also shows the visualisation of the altitude and traces the path of the aircraft as it passes
                through the sky. The position of the aircraft updates every 5.5 seconds. Each aircraft is marked with
                it's callsign and the country of origin. The information on display has been kept to a minimum to allows
                viewers to have a clear and unimpeded view of the visualisation.</p>
            <p>
                The sketch uses the opensky-network API to pull in aircraft coordinates and metadata. My intent
                with this sketch was to visualise and unveil the often hidden activities in the skies above us. Not all
                aircraft flying are commercial, cargo, private, or military. Some aircraft have hidden agendas, often
                hidden behind false callsigns. This <a
                    href="https://thewire.in/political-economy/the-unfinished-india-story-of-a-ukraine-plane-and-a-bribery-investigation"
                    target="_blank">article</a> <span>↗</span> elucidates one such incident. Websites such as
                FlightAware
                and FlightRadar24 do show the aircraft in our vicinity, but it's difficult to visualise the data with a
                2D visual. The source of the data is not clear with these commercial websites. The data on
                opensky-network is
                crowd-sourced, and hence aircraft cannot be hidden unless they switch off their ADS-B transponders
                (highly unlikely as they won't show up on ATC radar, which has major safety implications).

                Before creating the 3D version, I initially tried using a standard 2D version of the sketch which would
                reveal aircraft information on mouse hover.

                However, this variation wasn't very useful in displaying information as it didn't illustrate the
                position of the aircraft in relation to the viewer. The 3D view was important in conveying relative
                position of the aircraft in the sky.

            <p><b>Development</b></p>
            <p>Developing this was far more complicated than I initially imagined. There were a lot of moving
                parts, although mostly to do with the visualisation rather than navigating the API itself. One of the
                biggest challenges was creating the trails in the sky, as well has having background refresh. However,
                this meant that I had to develop a system to
                identify individual aircraft and update their locations without creating a new array of aircraft
                everytime.</p>

                Having figured out the data structures of the aircraft lists, I had to figure out how to create the
                trails for each aircraft, which would extend from the coordinates. I used a slightly complicated
                solution of creating two PVectors which would extend from the 3D coordinates to create each edge of the
                trail. This was needed as it would adapt to the rotation of the aircraft (another maths challenge to
                solve!) as it turned. Along the journey, I even made a case for, and advocated a <a
