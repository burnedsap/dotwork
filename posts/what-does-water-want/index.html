  <p>This is a question I’ve never thought of asking myself, surprising considering the fact that water is a critical part of my life. I’ve never thought of water as an entity, as a being. It’s always been a resource for me, a necessity which doesn’t have it’s own autonomy, it’s own wants and needs. Nor have I paid attention to water communicating with me, in its various states and energy levels, or the marks it leaves behind when it interacts with other elements and objects. The ease of access with which water is accessed in many countries also plays a role in diminishing it’s value. The simple and ubiquitous tap, obfuscates the immense resources required to obtain clean water, safe for human consumption. Water has no say in the way that it is treated.</p>
<blockquote>But what if things were different? What if, in an alternate reality water had some form of autonomy, some say in the relationship between water and humans. What would that world look like? How would things change? How different would it be from our reality?</blockquote>
<p>This project attempts to explore this speculative reality, and piece together what this world would look like. Although purely speculative, the intent of this project and the resulting visuals is to have the viewer reflect on their relationship with water, and perhaps build a stronger, and more meaningful bond with water.</p>
<p>The explorations were manifested in various forms, from speculative objects, to magazine spreads.</p>
<p>Guided by Anthony Dunne and Fiona Raby from <a href="https://www.designedrealities.org">Designed Realities</a>.</p>
