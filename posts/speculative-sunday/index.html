  <p>EyeMyth is the only Media Arts Festival in India - unique in its intersection of Indian and Global art, culture and technology. A 3-day festival which took place from November 29th to December 1st 2019, the third day, called <strong>Speculative Sunday</strong> was devoted to speculating the cultural futures of India.</p>

<p>Speculative Sunday is a day devoted to hands-on workshops that visualise radical cultural futures for India, while learning new skills in Speculative Design &amp; Design Fiction. I was in charge of the entire day of the festival, which meant planning and designing everything from production, activities, people, to food, permissions and transport. With over a 100+ attendees, the day was a success and lots of learnings were gleaned from the day.</p>

<p>The success of Speculative Sunday was entirely down to the team which behind the larger EyeMyth Media Arts Festival, and I was very fortunate to have gotten the opportunity to work with them to design this day.</p>
