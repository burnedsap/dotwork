<p>Speculative Sunday is a day devoted to hands-on workshops that visualise radical cultural futures for India</p>
<p>EyeMyth is the only Media Arts Festival in India - unique in its intersection of Indian and Global art, culture and technology.</p>
<p>Dive into an exciting new world of unusual tools &amp; ideas with 50+ radical artists, designers and technologists from India, Australia, Switzerland and UK.</p>
<p>What it is?<br>
Speculative Sunday is a day devoted to hands-on workshops that visualise radical cultural futures for India, while learning new skills in Speculative Design &amp; Design Fiction.</p>
<p>What’s the day like? -<br>
We kick off the EyeMyth Sunday with ‘Bhavishya Bhojanalaya’ - a futuristic brunch curated by India’s leading food provocateur and chef Gresham Fernandes in collaboration with ‘The Good Slice’; served with a bouncing side of lo-fi music curated by indie label Skip-A-Beat.</p>
<p>What follows is a unique, fast-paced co-creation workshop on ‘Speculative Design’ - an increasingly in-demand global skillset for creatives. 20 groups will be led by expert facilitators on a hands-on, co-creation journeys into the future of Mumbai and India in 2040.</p>
<p>High Tea features a sharing of ‘HUM.2035' - a highly successful global project in Speculative Design &amp; Design Fiction. Artists, animators and writers create a wall of projections from the workshop with the delegates for the evening party.</p>
<p>The evening wraps up with a series of ‘Audiovisual Performances by Future Fiction ft. Plan-B’- effectively blending the workshop, performances and afterparty into one giant seamless celebration owned by everyone.</p>
<p>Who am I learning from?<br>
The workshop is facilitated by innovation studio Quicksand (<a href="http://www.quicksand.co.in">www.quicksand.co.in</a>) which is providing 20 design researchers who will be paired with 20 domain experts to conduct the workshop</p>

<blockquote>But what if things were different? What if, in an alternate reality water had some form of autonomy, some say in the relationship between water and humans. What would that world look like? How would things change? How different would it be from our reality?</blockquote>
<p>This project attempts to explore this speculative reality, and piece together what this world would look like. Although purely speculative, the intent of this project and the resulting visuals is to have the viewer reflect on their relationship with water, and perhaps build a stronger, and more meaningful bond with water.</p>
<p>The explorations were manifested in various forms, from speculative objects, to magazine spreads.</p>
