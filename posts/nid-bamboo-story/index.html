      <h4>Overview</h4>
      <span>The Design Panorama is a permanent exhibition in the National Institute of Design (NID). One half of the exhibit changes every year, and I was tasked with the job of redoing it for 2016. The brief; The NID Bamboo Story. After extensive research on the history of NID and conducting various interviews, I set about forming a narrative. Directing and managing the various aspects of the exhibition was challenging but it was a great learning experience. I designed all the graphic panels of the exhibition as well as dealing with the administrative red tape that comes with loaning the rare bamboo exhibits.</span>
