				<p>Potholes are a pain, and so is wasting energy. So my friend and I decided to make something. We conceptualised of a suspension that would harness electricity from its vertical movement. Using Faradayâ€™s Law of Electromagnetism, we devised of a solution. We attached a magnet and solenoid to the suspension of a mountain bike and went for a ride on the road built by the municipality. A peak voltage of 5V and averaging 0.5V was achieved with the prototype.</p>
				
				<p>This concept can be scaled up to fit bigger vehicles and produce a lot of electricity that can be used by the vehicle. We took this idea to the BMW Group, turns out they already had a patent on a similar application but they liked our work anyway.</p>
