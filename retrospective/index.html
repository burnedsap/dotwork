<h2 class="post-headers">Retrospective</h2>
<section class="posts-wrapper">
  <div class="retrospective-text-text">
    <p>A retrospective is to look back at events that have taken place in the past. The process of retrospection is a useful one, as it allows me to reflect on my work and try to figure out what I want to be doing in the future. I do not have a profession I can identify with, or a line of work that I know I want to be doing. I like making things, and hopefully this auto-retrospection will allow me, or you, the viewer of this page to glean insights into what I should be making in the future. </p>

  <div class="retrospective-text-text">
    <p>This retrospective attempts to capture from my archive the things I have found interesting, enjoyed the process of making, and the important failures. These have been grouped into larger themes or threads.</p>
    <p> If you see something, say something at hello@salilparekh.work.</p>
