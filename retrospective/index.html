<h2 class="post-headers">Retrospective</h2>
<section class="posts-wrapper">
  <div class="retrospective-text-text">
    <p>A retrospective is to look back at events that have taken place in the past. The process of retrospection is a useful one, as it allows me to reflect on my work and try to figure out what I want to be doing in the future. I do not have a profession I can identify with, or a line of work that I know I want to be doing. I like making things, and hopefully this auto-retrospection will allow me, or you, the viewer of this page to glean insights into what I should be making in the future. </p>
  </div>
  <div class="retrospective-text-text">
    <p>This retrospective attempts to capture from my archive the things I have found interesting, enjoyed the process of making, and the important failures. These have been grouped into larger themes or threads.</p>

    <h2 class="retrospective-text-header">Speculations</h2>
    <p>A common thread through my projects is that of speculation, or trying to create something that doesn't exist. Speculative design gives me the license to daydream and try to make the fanciful things that I draw out in my notebook. The license however, doesn't guarantee that you'll do a good job of it, and I've come to realise that although it's easy to make speculative creations, they may not necessarily be successful at telling the stories I want to tell.</p>
    <p>Speculative design requires the mastery of narrative gymnastics, a subtle yet effective communication–which is not easy to pull off. Even if I'm not satisfied with the things that I create (like the <a href="http://theplanetarybureau.com">The Planetary Bureau</a>), the process is always incredibly enlightening as I learn so much while iterating.</p>

    <p>I studied Exhibition Design, the study of storytelling through physical spaces at the National Institute of Design (NID) while getting my Bachelor of Design. I'll be honest, it's not what I wanted to study but the department at NID allowed me to do so much more than advertised. I learnt how to craft narratives in multiple dimensions, using a wide variety of mediums and storytelling devices. This ended up being incredibly useful in everything I do now: creating virtual spaces in extended reality, facilitating research sessions, hosting workshops, immersive exhibits and so much more.</p>

    <p>I started learning to code in high school and at first, I didn't quite understand how it would be useful. But then I realised I could finish my art assignments rapidly using generative art, and since then I've come to see coding as an incredibly useful skill. The ability to use a computer to do what I want, in the way I want to, is fascinating experiences. Giving instructions to this artificial thinking machine has opened up possibilities for doing things I still cannot fully comprehend.</p>

    <h2 class="retrospective-text-header">Design Thinking</h2>
    <p>Right after graduating from the National Institute of Design, having studied Exhibition Design, I wanted to get a better understanding of 'Human-Centred Design (HCD)'. So, I started working at Quicksand, a design thinking and innovation consultancy. Very quickly I realised that it was in fact, exactly what I wanted to be doing. The HCD process is a multifaceted one, which is continuously evolving. The entire process, from research all the way to prototyping is incredibly exciting. Not only is there so much to do, but also so much to learn! The opportunity to work with different people, different cultures, and different environments is what makes this so fulfilling.</p>
    <p>There are so many projects I'd love to share–but unfortunately, they are confidential.</p>

            HCD Toolkits are admittedly, some of the most un-interesting, and un-engaging documents you can come across. The FinLab toolkit is an attempt at creating an easy to thumb through HCD manual for both facilitators and participants, with the intent of providing accessible and relevant information.

            UNICEF piloted their social impact entrepreneurship programme in Kosovo and wanted to replicate the same in Tajikistan. In order to do so, they needed to contextualise the content and curriculum in order to make it relevant and set up a system to train new cohorts.

          The internet is a space which continues to be very effectively used by advertising and tech companies–what if their ways of working and using the internet and other digital tools and spaces can be leveraged by organisations in the adolescent sexual and reproductive health sector to boost the effectiveness of their platforms and activities?

    <h2 class="retrospective-text-header">Physical Computing</h2>
    <p>Using a push-button to light up a small LED isn't the most engaging activity and my outlook toward physical computing wasn't great. But I stuck at it, as I was fascinated with the idea of giving physical objects a 'software', or programming something outside the boundaries of a screen. Soon I realised that I could give objects a 'life' and tell stories using these active objects. Working with base level electronics has given me a much better understanding of how digital technology at large functions, and more importantly, how I can make things for myself. Making bespoke tools and  objects not only for various custom projects, but also to build hardware and software stacks independent from Big Tech.</p>

            Can a textile feel alive and respond to my touch? Muslin is one of the first fabrics I've interacted with, and I love how it feels to touch. But does the muslin feel the way? This piece gives muslin the ability to interact with the person holding it.

            I've always wondered what a life of a curtain is like. Looking out of the window all day and night, what do they think about? What if a curtain that could express its thoughts? What do curtains dream of at night? To do so, I built a curtain that remembers all that it sees outside the window during the day, and hallucinates its memories at night.

        This controller detects changes in the electromagnetic field, which is effectively the language of electronic devices. The device provides an interface to the world of electronic chatter, which is otherwise invisible to humans.

          This installation creates bubbles when people in the room hold hands and make an unbroken chain with the machine. The moment the chain breaks, the bubbles stop. Simple, yet very effective.
