          >I had this watch from my flatmate. It always reminded me of her and
          the time while living together during our undergrads. It was a golden
          watch, similar to the popular ones from Casio. Its face had an
          octagonal shape, however, every second side was a little bit bigger.
          Maybe it is better described as a square (approx. 40x40mm) with cut
          off corners. The outer edges had a small bevel. With a margin to all
          sides of approx. 4mm, the inner part of the watch face was not
          metallic golden, but black. The bottom third has been filled with two
          buttons. One covering two thirds on the left of the area, and the
          other filling the rest. They were black as well, but soft rubber
          plastic. The right one had in the center a logo engraved. It looked a
          little bit like a teardrop. Above the buttons has been a rectangular
          LCD display with small rounded corners, yet an inverted one (meaning
          everything was black, except the letters). It had a small margin to
          the left and right from the black frame edge and aligned at the top
          with the corners of the octagon. It was a nice LCD display, not with
          7-segment numbers, but more pixels. In very big, very rectangular
          digits, the time was shown in the upper ⅔ of the screen. Hours,
          minutes, and a little smaller, seconds. Below the current date: three
          capital letters for the weekday, year, month, and day in digits. Above
          the upper left corner of the screen, in silver/white capital letters
          “NIXON” has been printed on. Fairly small, smaller than the letters
          displaying the date. The watch band has been a typical metal watch
          band. Golden like the outer octagon. A little bit wider at the hinge
          at the octagon (to meet the corners), then becoming more narrow until
          it follows a perfect parallel shape again. Like any metal watch band,
          it showed its typical sideways masonry-like pattern to allow it to
          wrap around the wrist, while having 5 columns.</i

        Reflections
      </h2>
      <p>
        The first realisation I had was when I compared the description I gave
        to my partner, to the one I recieved! The description I received was
        rich in detail and very accurate (to the number!). Whereas the
        description I gave was more about the feeling and function, and less
        about the object itself. Was this to do with our respective
        nationalities (German and Indian), or was it simply the nature of the
        object itself which evoked different natures of description?
      </p>
      <p>
        The description I recieved was immensely detailed, and read like a
        production brief. In some ways, it actually read like pseudocode! As I
        went through the description, I could visualise the different layers
        coming together to form the visual of the wristwatch. Since the
        description was so detailed, there wasn't much left to creative
        interpretation. Instead the challenge lay in accurately recreating the
        watch. My aim was to create a picture perfect representation of the
        description.
      </p>

      <p>
        Although I did have some previous experience in writing code
        (Processing), I got up to speed with the various functions of p5js.
        Although some of the language is different, I've started to figure out
        how to work with the new language. I knew that the biggest challenge I
        would face would be navigating around the canvas. I've never quite
        gotten the hang of understanding the coordinates of the canvas, and so I
        created a handly little GPS on the top-right corner which would tell me
        the location of the mouse. Ideally I would've hidden this away in the
        console, but it's much easier to see it on the canvas itself while
        working. With this nifty tool, I could see the coordinates of my mouse,
        which would help inform of me where to position objects on the screen.
      </p>
      <p>
        I started off with creating a series of rectangles to 'sketch' out the
        watch, and used modular variables to make this process faster. Here I
        made an incorrect decision to <i>not use</i> rectMode(CENTER), and I
        feel it would've definitely helped create the watch much faster, and in
        a modular fashion which could allow for simple and easy resizing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once I had the basic structure in place, I used my own digital Casio
        wristwatch to understand how LCD screens looked like, so that I could
        replicate certain effects, such as the typeface, the faint background,
        and the nearly imperceptible blur when the characters change. I used
        hacky method using if/else loops to ensure that the characters would
        render correctly when in single digits on the screen.
      </p>
      <p>
        To create the strap, and accurately render it, I used the lerpColor()
        function to enable the shading that I desired on the individual strap
        units. After completing most of the watch, I realised that it would run
        quite slowly. I shifted most of the code from the draw() function to the
        setup() function so that the same elements weren't being redrawn every
        frame. This definitely improved the rendering performance.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've always been fascinated by the
        <a href="https://css-art.com">highly detailed CSS paintings</a> and p5js
        allows for something similar where it is possible to create something
        that looks 'realistic' with just a few lines of code!
