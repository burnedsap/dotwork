      <p>
        The resultant creation from an exquisite corpse is often a complete
        unknown. This kind of generative process employs the use of the
        <i>human random</i>-the creativity which is borne from each of our own
        unique experiences. Stringing together multiple highly qualitative
        random variables is a wonderful recipe, the results of which are just as
        jarring as they are unexpectedly enlightening.

        Once we had exchanged body parts, the character I ended up with was
        visually unique to say the least! This character, moulded by the mixed
        histories of abstract art, a brutal past, and the idea of pure
        spirituality, would now inhabit a world created by my p5.js sketch. They
        (the character) have a rich tradition of performance and the arts, and
        would like to find a medium of practice within their new embodiment.
        They have a deep interest in exploring the intersection of theatre,
        dance, and music, to tell their own personal stories. With such a
        diverse and often violent history, they have a lot to say, with the
        intent to inspire others to tell their own stories.

      <h2>
        Design Process
      </h2>
      <p>
        Prior to starting any work, I knew that I wanted to explore the movement
        and form with this character. With the complexity of the components of
        the character (especially the torso), the wiser approach would be to use
        images and generate novel forms. I initially tried to use the different
        components as individual objects, but soon came to the realisation that
        image manipulation within p5.js was not ideal, and other tools would be
        better suited for this task. Even after manipulating the different
        elements (head, torso and legs), connecting them together to generate
        new forms was proving to be quite difficult. The dimensions of the image
        were different with every source component and hence it was proving
        impossible to create a perfectly formed character.
      </p>

      <p>
        To get around this limitation, I created different character variations
        using image manipulation software to ensure that the different
        components would fit perfectly with each other. Performing the same task
        within p5.js led to gaps and spaces between the body parts. The multiple
        variations of the characters were uploaded and used as the elements for
        the performance. Each variation of the character was mapped to a
        different number on the keyboard, and a different position on the
        screen. To accomplish this, I created a function which used values from
        0-9 to compose each figure on the corresponding part of the screen. I
        envisioned the canvas to be a stage for the charater to perform, with
        each number from 0-9 triggering a different scene of the performance.
        With each scene, a different character variation is called upon,
        foregrounded on a particular section of the stage.
      </p>

      <p>
        Audio is a key component of this performance. In addition to a different
        variation of the character being called upon each scene of the
        performance, a unique sound sample is also triggered. The sound samples
        were downloaded from
        <a href="https://www.soundpacks.com" target="_blank">soundpacks</a> and
        edited to create snappier samples to be used as the corresponding sound
        for every scene. The intent is to have the viewer play the sketch as an
        instrument, directing the performance of the character. With each scene,
        the viewer will see the character in a different form, and hear a
        different sound. The sounds are just long enough so that multiple sounds
        can be heard at the same time, overlapping over each other to create an
        abstract soundscape.
      </p>

      <p>
        In order to tell a story through the sketch, I added breaks in between
        the scenes. Inspired by the slides of text that appear between scenes of
        silent films (à la Charlie Chaplin), the interludes tell the story of
        the character. Summarised into brief thoughts, the character attempts to
        communicate with the viewer and talk about their journey. This element
        is important as it serves as a visual break between the scenes, and
        enhances the narrative aspect of the performance.
      </p>

      >
      <p>
        One of the key techniques used in the sketch was the use of
        <code>eval()</code>. This allowed me to easily call out different scenes
        which caused the correct character variation to be displayed and the
        appropriate sound to be played. By evaluating the programmatically
        generated <code>strings</code>, the corresponding functions are called
        upon. The intent was to write as little code as possible, and minimise
        repetition.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once I had the basic sketch completed, I started adding in the smaller
        transitions and visual elements to tie the whole piece together. I
        edited the sound to make it trail off in certain samples, and give a
        sensation of space. The background coloured lights in the stage was
        carefully manipulated with <code>colorMode(HSB)</code> and
        <code>random()</code> to give the sensation of flickering stage lights.
        The opacity of the <code>background()</code> was reduced and the opacity
        of the text was tied to <code>millis()</code> to give the appearance of
        the text slowly fading in. I also used a
        <code>sin(frameCount)</code> with the main text to make it pulse ever so
        slightly. Just as I was putting in the final touches, I realised that
        the character would look much better with a drop shadow, which would
        allow it to 'pop' out of the stage. A quick scan of the p5js reference
        page revealed the presence of the <code>drawingContext</code> function,
        which allowed me to quickly add in a drop shadow to every image without
        having to edit the images and reupload them.

      <h2>
        Reflections
      </h2>
      <p>
        What started out as an experiment with modular functions and a fun
        character building activity, transformed into a project with meaning and
        a platform to explore methods to refine the visual and experiential
        aspects of the sketch. In retrospect, it perhap sounds a little
        far-fetched to see meaning in a disfigured character created with the
        help of an exquisite corpse exercise, but once I saw potential in the
        story, I found the motivation to work on creating a cohesive experience.
        I felt like a director, producer, and conductor all rolled into,
        managing different aspects of the performance and the storytelling.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is definitely possible to elevate and improve a p5js sketch using
        basic visual elements of contrast, form, and motion, along with a strong
        narrative. P5js is after all, just another tool which can be used to
        tell stories, both good or bad. The capabilities of the platform can
        afford new kinds of visual and aural experiences. The ability to create
        bespoke functionality for certain outputs and results makes it
        especially useful and powerful. Just as p5js is a custom library for
        javascript, we too can create functions to make a framework for our own
        purposes.
