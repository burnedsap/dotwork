        Games are objectively a wonderful medium, and video games especially are
        a great way to tell stories. The interactivity, and immersiveness make
        it a compelling method to communicate narratives, and I was very
        excited, and nervous about making a game. In the past I have used Unity,
        although primarily as an interactive 3D viewing tool, using camera
        controller prefabs. The programming component of Unity is immensely
        frightening, and I've seen enough to know how complex game programming
        can get. So, I approached this project with a fair bit of nervous
        energy, although still very excited to finally create a game of my own.
      </p>
      <p>
        After much work, and even more to work on, I present,
        <b>Museum of Salil</b>! This is an autobiographical game which lets
        players get to know me as they wander through the museum. Play the game
        to find out more!

        One of my favourite games of all time is Pokémon Emerald, and it's a
        game I still play to this very day in fact. Over time, I've come to
        notice and appreciate the narrative, the gameplay, the various
        gamification methods, and the complex Pokémon mechanisms. Everytime I
        play the game, I notice another element about it that I really enjoy. I
        don't think I've found a game in the last 16 years which has dethroned
        Emerald as my favourite game. Portal 2 comes close, and so does The
        Stanley Parable. A common thread running across all three of these games
        is the slow unravelling of the story with time and progress. These games
        don't reveal the context and the story entirely, but instead, allow you
        to slowly discover whats happening as you progress through the game and
        speak to the characters. I really enjoy this style of gameplay and
        narrative and wanted imbibe the same characteristics within my game as
        well.
      </p>
      <p>
        As for the autobiographical part, it was only right that I choose a
        museum as a medium through which to tell my story. Not only does it a
        great way to tell a story through a space, layer by layer, room by room,
        it also makes sense considering the fact that I studied Exhibition
        Design, and learnt how to tell stories through spaces. I thought of
        creating multiple rooms, each of which would reveal a little bit about
        me. Akin to postmodernist storytelling a la Attempts on Her Life, each
        room, or story would be disconnected from each other, yet still be about
        a common topic: me. I also thought it'll be funny to create a museum
        about myself, a shrine to my ego. Although I do sincerely create this as
        a storytelling technique, there's no smoke without fire.
      </p>
      <p>
        With the non-linear storytelling technique I didn't have a storyboard,
        and so I worked on figuring out the ideal configuration of the space,
        which would work well both technically and visually.

        Development
      </h2>

      <p>
        Before I had written a line of code, or drawn any art, I knew I wanted
        to create a pixel art based game, as a homage to Pokémon Emerald. To
        whitebox the game, I created a 3-frame character sprite, and quickly
        sketched out the different scenes, using lines and words drawn across
        the screen. I would use these assets till I had the basic code down, and
        then work on swapping out these assets for something more substantial.

        The initial challenge I faced was rendering and controlling the main
        character. I knew that I'd need to animate the main character controlled
        by the player, which would need to bump into other objects and trigger
        conversations. For this I needed to build out functionality which would
        cycle through sprites, and recognise collisions. I used the
        <a herf="https://molleindustria.github.io/p5.play/" target="blank"
          >p5 play</a
        >
        library which allowed me integrate these functions quickly. Ideally I'd
        have liked to have only used p5js, and nothing more, but time was short
        and I couldn't find other easy alternatives.
      </p>
      <p>
        After a few iterations, I had the basic functions figured out with the
        character moving across the screen with the sprite animations, colliding
        into NPC's and triggering a dialogue box, and moving across rooms. At
        this point I realised that the code was getting quite messy, and it was
        difficult to navigate through it on the p5js editor. I downloaded the
        folder, and switched to working on Brackets, an open source code editor,
        which also allowed me to quickly duplicate lines, and preview visuals. I
        also started packaging sections of code into functions, which I
        separated into different javascript files. This let me segment my code
        into different parts and made it quicker and easier to navigate and
        create mental models of the code structure.

        Once I was happy with the code, I started creating assets for the game.
        This took far longer than I had initially accounted for. Creating
        multiple sprites for the player controlled character took a full day.
        Animating is difficult, and perhaps even more difficult with the
        constraint of such few pixels. Communicating the motion of movement
        through the shifting of pixels is quite challenging. Although creating
        the spaces was easier in comparison, I used sprite maps from Pokémon
        Emerald to help me architect the spaces, and take colour and pattern
        references. Creating architectural elements in a pixel art style is
        tricky, and the spritesheet reference helped accelerate the process of
        creating the spaces.

        As the finished art assets were exported, I started to integrate them
        into the game. The features within the assets guided the development of
        the game on top of the basic functionality. For example, the new
        completed character needed a different control setup as compared to the
        version used for the whiteboxing. The walls and and other elements in
        the assets facilitated the addition of colliders to prevent the
        character from escaping the canvas. The exhibits required the addition
        of triggers, which would trigger the dialogue box to appear, with the
        correct text to appear. The lines of code kept increasing, and I would
        keep separating the functions into new javascript files to retain
        readability.

        Every new challenge or difficulty presented me with an opportunity to
        refactor my code, and clean it up. Iteration by iteration, the game
        started to take shape, with new features being added, and old ones
        removed. This process got me to do some more research on p5js and the p5
        play library–which helped me simplify the code and make it more
        efficient. I did run into a bizarre problem, in which the frame rate of
        the game would drop from a constant 30fps to 1fps within half a minute.
        After having studied the performance logs, I spotted the culprit. I was
        drawing the collider sprites for the walls every frame, which was
        causing the brutal slowdown. I implemented a system which would behave
        as a pseudo-setup() function by checking for NPC sprites. If there
        weren't any, the that block of code would run, before populating the
        scene with NPC sprites. This helped me create the wall sprites one, and
        thus resolving the performance issue.

        As the game development concluded, I shared a copy of the game with a
        few of my friends to playtest it and get some feedback. From this
        feedback, I implemented a more efficient interaction strategy, improved
        readability, added new dialogues, and added interactive elements. This
        was an important part of the process as it helped me verify the
        narrative strategy, and helped improve the playability of the game.
      </p>
      <h2>
        Reflection
      </h2>
      <p>
        Making a game has been a dream of mine, for a while now. To be able to
        finally create a game, especially one that is inspired by my favourite
        game of all time is very satisfying. Starting out, I didn't think I'd be
        able to actually create any game, let alone this one. Having briefly
        used Unity, I was also worried about developing the game visually blind,
        as in not having the ability to visually place objects on the canvas.
        But as the smaller blocks and functions started to come together, I was
        able to visualise the game logic and start putting together more complex
        functions. I also started to notice how I could make the code more
        efficient, and look for performance bugs.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once I had the basic game functionality up and running, my process
        became a lot more iterative. My planning sketches did not account for
        many features since I never thought I'd be able to implement them. For
        example, the dialogue feature only came about through trial and error in
        the coding phase. Once I knew it was possible, I had to go back to the
        drawing board and figure out how I could implement it properly.
      </p>
      <p>
        Every new feature required me either clean up my code or figure out
        solutions to integrating the new features without breaking existing
        ones. Creating the 'esc' overlay required me to completely restructure
        the way I built out scenes. I was creating and deleting colliders
        individually, line by line, calling out each variable explicitly. To be
        able to restart the game via the 'esc' overlay, I had to delete the
        colliders before switching scenes. Instead of checking for the scene
        number and writing out long if statements, I took a closer look at the
        documentation to figure out solutions. p5 play had a function to group
        together collider objects, and the groups could be deleted with a single
        line of code. With this nifty little solution, I could reduce 30-50
        lines of code and implement the restart feature effectively.
      </p>
      <p>
        I really enjoyed the process of creating the game, and working with
        complex, interconnected functions. It was surprising that I was able to
        do it at all! It was interesting to see myself writing out so much code,
        and ensuring that it worked well. I also enjoyed the iterative design
        process, and the experience of cleaning and refactoring my code layer by
        layer, function by function. I'm hoping to make a lot more games in the
        future!
