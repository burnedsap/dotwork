      <p>
        Steganography is the technique of hiding messages within plain sight.
        The message is usually encrypted within something oridnary to avoid
        detection, and is decoded by the reciever with a special set of
        instructions. The messages itself are usually codified for an additional
        layer of security. An example of steganography is the use of invisible
        ink, which is used to write messages on a piece paper which is then
        overlayed with a standard innocuous message in real ink. Upon exposure
        to heat, the hidden message is revealed. The invisible ink wouldn't be
        noticeable to someone who opens the letter without knowing of the
        existence of the hidden message or the instructions of how to access it.
      </p>

      <p>
        I didn't have to look to far to think of a context to design a
        steganograph technique for. According to the UK based research firm
        <a
          href="https://www.comparitech.com/blog/vpn-privacy/surveillance-states/"
          target="_blank"
          >Comparitech</a
        >, India ranks third on a list of surveillance states, closely following
        Russia and China. Not that a UK based firm needed to make me aware of
        this. The Indian government is applying finishing touches to a National
        Social Registry of all its citizens, created partly with the help of the
        Aadhaar identification system. This will help the government track every
        movement and event of its citizens. The BJP led Modi government is also
        pushing forward with its plans to implement a
        <b>National Registry of Citizens</b>, in a reported attempt to identify
        illegal citizens. However, initial signs show that the government is
        using this data to target ethnic and religious minorities. The Act was
        passed under heavy protest, with the Delhi Police employing various
        surveillance measures to frame protestors with false evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
        This government has also passed the <b>Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA)</b>,
        with allows for the arrest of anyone on mere suspicion, and without any  proof or evidence. This law has been used with impunity on the
        leaders of the protest against the <b>Citizenship Amendment Act</b> and on
        other political opponents. India currently has no data protection laws
        in place, and there isn't a data protection authority in place. The
        government has also been accussed of using an Israeli software called
        Pegasus to illegaly obtain Whatsapp chats from Indian citizens. Although
        this claim has been denied, they are working with Whatsapp to track
        certain messages. A <b>Social Media Communication Hub (SMCH)</b> is
        being set up to collect and analyse content of social media profiles.
        There are concerns that the purpose of the <b>SMCH</b> is to

        In an ongoing investigation of the death of Sushant Singh Rajput,
        Whatsapp chat histories were obtained by the
        <b>Narcotics Control Bureau</b> by simply cloning the mobile phones of
        those involved, bypassing Whatsapp's end-to-end encryption. These
        transcripts were then used to charge implicate certain individuals for
        the use of marijuana, in what was mostly a media led trial, supported by
        the BJP led government in an effort to draw attention away from the poor
        response to the COVID-19 pandemic and high rates of unemployment.

        The Medium
      </h2>
      <p>
        Whatsapp is the most widely used messaging app in India, with about 400
        million users as of 2019. Everyone with a smartphone will usually use
        Whatsapp as their main platform of communication. A popular method of
        keeping in touch with each other and larger groups is with the help of
        'Good Morning messages.' These are in the form of both images and text.
        The images usually contain a cheery message with colourful visuals of
        flowers, babies, mountains, and lakes. These messages are sent so
        frequently that they are often the cause of many phones filling up their
        memory. On the eve of 2018, users in India sent about 20 billion
        messages, causing slowdowns and server outages.

        Although usually innocuous, some messages contain xenophobic, casteist,
        and sexist content. These images are forwarded hundreds of times,
        causing them to be shared exponentially. Some of these Whatsapp forwards
        and messages have incited mob lynchings which have led to deaths of
        several innocent people. To combat the spread of misinformation,
        Whatsapp has imposed limits on the number of message forwards.

        don't read or scrutinise the content of the images they share and

        I was keen to use a system of steganography which would use popular
        mediums and communication channels, but would escape detection even from
        those looking to find any kind of evidence. Using good morning images
        through Whatsapp is a great way to smuggle messages through, since the
        rate at which images are created and shared would make it near
        impossible to track down. I forsee this system being used to communicate
        and broadcast sensitive or incriminating information without the
        detection of the government.
      </p>
      <h2>
        Steganography
      </h2>
      <p>
        Hiding messages within the source code of image files is a commonly used
        technique, and as such would be detected with easily accessible software
        and decryption algorithms. This method involves editing the bits of an
        image to encrypt messages, with minimal change to the image itself.
      </p>
      <p>
        I took a simpler approach toward this problem, and decided to use the
        pixels themselves as a way to encode messages. Each pixel has 3
        channels—<span style="color:red;">Red</span>,
        <span style="color:green;">Green</span>, and
        <span style="color:blue;">Blue</span>–each with a capacity of <b>256</b>
        (0-255) spaces. By assigning the value of each space, or a combination
        of spaces to a particular character, data can be stored. Although this
        will lead to a change in colour of the pixels of the image, the colour
        channels can be adjusted for each image to ensure that there are minimal
        changes in the visual. Most images shared on Whatsapp are usually of
        poor quality, with plenty of artefacts such as colour shifting and
        fringing. The length of the message and the complexity of encryption can
        also be adjusted to ensure that the changes made are minimal.
      </p>
      <p>
        The pixels on the outer edges of the image are usually not as
        prominently seen, and are ideal spaces to edit pixels and encrypt
        information. Additional layers of encryption can also be added by using
        multiple channels to encrypt characters, which can be further encrypted
        to hide the real message.
      </p>
      <p>
        The encryption and decryption process is very simple. Upload the image,
        type in your message, and hit encrypt button to download. Similarly, to
        decrypt, upload the image and hit decrypt button to see the message. The
        length of the message and the contents of the cipher can be adjusted
        within the code, and potentially be shared as a key to decrypt the base
        message, which itself can be further encrypted for increased security.

        I initially explored ideas of both visual and aural steganography,
        before settling on the visual approach. Using pixel based encoding
        seemed like an ideal solution, especially since the encoding is not
        mathematical, and there is plenty of scope for changing the variables
        and creating highly secure encryption systems. This is also uses the
        artefacts created by the compression used by Whatsapp to hide the
        deformities of the pixels based encryption.
      </p>

      <p>
        Before I wrote a single line of code, I started laying out the different
        functions or blocks of code, which would be needed at different steps of
        the process, such as <b>Image Upload</b>, <b>Pixel Processing</b>,
        <b> Coding and Decoding Engines</b> and <b>Image Download</b>.
      </p>

        />
        <small><i>Flow of code and the use of function blocks</i></small>
      </div>

      <p>
        Once I had figured out an outline of the code, I started writing out the
        different blocks. I wasn't quite sure of how the different blocks would
        interact with each other, and so I first used global variables so that
        the different functions could speak to each other. The
        <b>Image Upload</b> and <b>Image Download</b> blocks were easy to figure
        out, but it was the pixel manipulation which was difficult to crack. I
        first attempted to use the <code>pixels[]</code> method, but that seemed
        a little complicated. I ended up using the <code>get()</code> method,
        which was far easier to use, and worked perfectly, even though it's not
        as efficient as <code>pixels[]</code>.
      </p>
      <div class="image-single">
        <img
          src="glitch-assets/2020_10_05 13_47 Office Lens.jpg"

          width="100%"
        />
        <small><i>Details of encoding data within pixels</i></small>
      </div>
      <p>
        Using a <code>for()</code> loop, I located the first row of pixels, and
        stored their value in a local array. Currently, the function only
        captures 160 pixels on the top right of the image, but theoretically,
        the entire rows of the image can be used. The value of these pixels were
        transferred to the encryption and decryption engines, which were two
        separate functions to either encrypt a message or decrypt an image.
      </p>

      <p>
        Both these engines needed a cipher which would be the key needed for
        both encryption and decryption. Initially I used a long list of
        <code>if</code> and <code>else if</code> loops to assign values to each
        character which ended up taking 150 lines of code (<a
          href="https://editor.p5js.org/burnedsap/sketches/Qh5MaONGW"
          target="_blank"
          >see here</a
        >). Later I switched to using the <code>charAt()</code> function, which
        was also being used to break down the message to be encrypted into
        individual letters. This reduced the length of the cipher function to
        just a single line of code, and could potentially be used as a custom
        key to be input by the user.

      </div>
      <p>
        To keep the sketch running smoothly, and to trigger functions only when
        needed, I removed the <code>draw()</code> function, and used a series of
        callbacks. This not only led to a much cleaner and intuitive interface,
        but also allowed the code to run much quicker. I used a few hacks such
        as drawing <code>rect()</code> to overwrite text where needed, and
        changed the colour of the <code>input</code> text to hide certain
        unwanted elements. I added little indication lights and helpful text
        prompts where needed to help the user with the encryption and decryption
        process.

        Reflections
      </h2>

      <p>
        This form of steganography is defined by the context and the people who
        will most likely use it. Good morning messages shared via Whatsapp is a
        medium unto itself, and a channel that can be used for covert
        communications. It is troubling that such a system would ever have to be
        used, but given the current circumstances, there is a need for such
        systems especially when digital privacy is non-existent. India is in a
        crisis, and being governed by a ruling party with xenophobic, casteist
        and patriarchal values, which will go to great lengths to stop any kind
        of opposition against it. When faced with an ethically corrupt Supreme
        Court, dubious parlimentary practices, widespread censorship and
        unchecked police brutality, Indian citizens will have to get smarter in
        their methods to rally and organise dissent.
      </p>
      <p>
        Using existing mediums such as Whatsapp is a great way to spread
        awareness and work collectively to undo the damage done. We will have to
        evade the personal armies of those in power, and continue to fight day
        after day. It certainly helps if the technology and the mediums are used
        are the ones we are familiar with, all while employing methods to avoid
        detection.
