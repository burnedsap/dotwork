        Data visualisation has always seemed quite straightforward to me.
        Telling stories with the help of data is easy enough. There's plenty of
        ways to do so, for example using bar graphs, pie charts, alluvial
        diagrams, waffle grids, amongst
        <a href="https://datavizproject.com" target="_blank">others</a>. However
        I've never given much thought to embedding stories and narratives within
        the data visualisation. Telling a personal story through a period of
        time with data is new for me.
      </p>
      <p>
        I wanted to track a data point which is unique to my context and
        surroundings. I initially thought of tracking my digital behaviours, but
        it wasn't an accurate reflection of me, in this moment. I narrowed in on
        either tracking the number of times I would bite my nails, or the number
        of times the door to my room would open. However I quickly realised that
        the moment I would become aware of biting my nails, I would stop doing
        it. Although it's a great way to perhaps stop biting my nails, I'd
        probably end up with no data, or inaccurate data. And so I started
        tracking the number of times I would open the door to my room.
      </p>
      <p>
        Before I started tracking the data, I wanted to figure out what my
        visualisation would look like. This would help define the parameters I
        would need to collect.

        Although I initially got bogged down in trying to use traditional data
        visualisation techniques, I realised that they didn't convey the essence
        of the data. I wanted to convey the long gaps in between me opening my
        door. I wanted to tell the story of my routine through the opening of
        the door.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, I figured out a simple solution to the problem. Just as I would
        draw out my idea or the story I wanted to convey, the data visualisation
        would do the same thing.

        Now that I knew what the visualisation would look like, I started
        collecting the data in a

        Development
      </h2>
      <p>
        As I collected the data, I started work on translating the drawn
        sketches into an p5js sketch. As I started coding out the visualisation,
        I realised I had two big challenges.
      </p>
      <p>
        The first challenge was simply animating a line as it went from one end
        of the screen to the other end. I figured out that I would have to store
        the location of a point as it goes across the screen, and then draw a
        line using <code>vertex()</code>. I didn't want to simply turn off
        background refresh, as I needed the background to refresh for the
        visuals. Although in theory, all was well, and the logic worked
        perfectly in Processing (Java), for some unknown reason, it simply
        refused to work in javascript. I was trying to use
        <code>PVector()</code> to store the location values of the point as it
        went across the screen. I was stuck at this point, but luckily
        <a href="https://mfadt-cc-olivierbrcknr.glitch.me/" target="_blank"
          >Olivier</a
        >
        came to the rescue with a
        <a
          href="https://editor.p5js.org/olivierbrcknr/sketches/JFp6zUqll"
          target="_blank"
          >system</a
        >
        that used an <code>Object</code> to store location values. This worked
        as I had envisioned, and now I had a system which would draw lines
        across the screen! A lot of work for a very simple visual element, but
        definitely worth the effort. Having successfully figured out how to draw
        <i>a</i> line, I got stuck in another quagmire which was drawing
        multiple lines across the screen, all while coordinating with another
        system which would sequentially create the doors.
      </p>
      <p>
        The second issue I ran into was the use of <code>setTimeout()</code>,
        and the way it would delay the drawing of the doors if there were any
        slowdowns in running the sketch. As it needs a time based value, I had
        to calculate the timing according to the speed at which the line would
        travel across the sketch. After some optimisation, the speed of the
        sketch changed, which affected the way the doors would be drawn. The
        speed is also dependent on speed of the computer upon which it runs.
        Hence, the sketch may or may not run well depending on the hardware of
        the computer. This is worrying as I couldn't find a fix for the issue.
      </p>
      <h2>
        Reflection
      </h2>
      <p>
        Of the many realisations I had while creating this sketch, the most
        profound one was during the process of creating my own data. Not only
        was it very empowering, but it helped me see myself through a different
        lens. It's strange to objectify myself with numbers, especially ones
        that I have consciously generated myself. I had to make an effort in not
        changing the way I went about my day. I also explored new ways of
        narration through data analysis and visualisation. There's a great story
        to be told through data, and the story becomes even better with some
        effort and thinking. Sometimes, it pays to keep it simple.
