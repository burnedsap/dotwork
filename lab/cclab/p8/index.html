      <h1>Consentful Interface</h1>
      <p>
        Although I've never actively thought of creating 'consentful'
        interfaces, I've designed a highly detailed one, simply by traversing
        the internet and using different kinds of technology. The need for a
        consentful interface is at it's highest when you, the user, feel a
        breach of privacy and the imbalanced power equation adversely affecting
        your experience. The wilful ignorance and the invasion of privacy is
        quite effective at helping me form an opinion on consentful interfaces.
      </p>
      <p>
        My Experimental Camera, the
        <a href="p6.html" target="_blank"><b>Questioning Camera</b></a> requires
        the use of the device camera, as well as the download of a machine
        learning model. The camera doesn't work without either of these
        components, but it is still possible to deliver a representative user
        experience if the viewer does not wish to use either component.

      <p>
        I created a flowchart to help explain the user journey across the
        camera.

        Initially I had planned for the camera to have multiple buttons and lots
        of readouts to keep the viewer informed about the functioning of the
        camera. However, I realised that a lot of these interfaces were
        superfluous, and it impeded the user's understanding of the camera and
        it's operation.

        Reflection
      </h2>
      <p>
        I simplified the interface, removed any excessive information and
        buttons. I had to remind myself that the goal is to make a
        <i>good</i> experience, and not just a consentful one. As Colin Chapman
        would say, "<i>Simplify, then add lightness.</i>" In my intent of
        creating an experience which would ensure a safe and consentful
        interaction, I couldn't lose sight of the overall user experience. I
        reduced the number of clicks needed, and adapted the information
        displayed according to the user's choices.

      <p>
        With the new interface, I wanted to make the user comfortable with the
        thought of using their camera, and using machine learning models.
        Unauthorised webcam usage and nefarious machine learning models have
        earned these features a bad reputation, and I wanted to create an
        interface which would keep the user in control of all the components,
        and only activate them when explicitly asked to. The intent is to make
        the user feel safe, by presenting all the information and being
        transparent about the usage of resources.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was important to not only present all the information, but also help
        the user access the experience if they didn't wish to use the camera, or
        the machine learning model. Even if the viewer didn't wish to use the
        camera, they could upload an image and use the machine learning model to
        see how the Questioning Camera works. If the user didn't wish to see
        enable access to the camera, or consent to the download and use of the
        machine learning model, they could view a small example image to see
        what the experience looks like. At any point of time, the viewer has the
        ability to click on the large 'X' button on the top right to return to
        the main screen from where they could choose another option. So perhaps
        the user having seen the example image could feel comfortable with
        allowing camera access, and switch to that mode from the main screen.
      </p>

      <p>
        What stood out immediately, while creating the reworked interface, was
        the amount of effort it took to give the user options. It's far more
        complex, with a lot more moving parts to take care of. Giving the user a
        choice to move around the interface also leads to the possibility of
        more errors and bugs. In hindsight, with 3 more weeks of coding
        practice, I would have preferred to completely rewrite the original
        Experimental Camera from the ground up. But I wanted to stick to the
        same code to see how much more challenging it would be to retrofit the
        additional functions. If I did rewrite the entire code, I would make it
        a lot more modular, and expandable as well.
