      <h1>The Context Clock</h1>
      <p>
        A clock doesn't just tell the time. It also gives us other planes of
        references, both literal and abstract. A clock can tell us whether it's
        time to work, to play, to socialise, or to sleep. It can also tell us
        whether it's time to be happy, sad, anxious or angry. A clock is so much
        more than an indicator of just time. This applies to all clocks, from
        the sundial to the Casio F-91W. A clock is a measure of time. A measure
        that we use to quantify our experiences. It's not necessary that time is
        the only measure that we quantify our experiences with. This measure can
        vary for people. For some it's personal milestones, and others, it's
        global measures. This measure changes constantly, evolving with our
        needs and desires.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some of these measures are passive, something to refer to once in a
        while. Others are a lot more active, something to compete with and
        observe closely. Some measures are inspirational, others are a warning.
        They can also remind you of your journey and eventual destination.

        Design Process
      </h2>
      <p>
        I hadn't thought of time with this level of scrutiny before. Time is an
        elastic medium. It expands and contracts as it wishes to. Often, we have
        no choice but to sway to it's rhythms. But sometimes, it is possible to
        take back control and own your time. Time is a construct we set for
        ourselves, and we can change it if we so wish to. I have't seen a clock
        for what it is for a while now. The numbers I see on a watch signify
        action. Influenced by working in a studio, the watch dictates my
        actions, whether I eat, sleep, work, or meet people. I often see time as
        a series of Calendar events. I sketched out a small prototype of the
        same.

        Time doesn't operate in isolation. It is largely defined by our
        experiences. Our emotions, state of being, the ambient temperature, or
        even the music we listen to can greatly affect how time moves. Time has
        a variable tempo. By adjusting the tempo, or cadence at which we live
        and experience, the perception of time can be changed. I created a small
        prototype inspired by the tempo-setting interface from Visual Jockey
        softwares such as Modul8 and VDMX.

        I ended up creating the sketch at the very top of the page, titled
        'Measures of Time', due to the fact that it was the only concept that
        reflected my perception of time accurately. The measures on the clock
        will change with time, and evolve as I grow as a person. I see those
        measure now, clear as day, but I will eventually see other measures to
        compare time with.
      </p>

      <h2>
        Reflections
      </h2>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        Through this process of sketching out new measures of time and concepts
        of watches, I realised that time is not only variable as a concept and
        perception, but in raw numbers as well. There are many ways through
        which time can be coded and replicated. Although time can be easily
        represented via the easily accessible <code>hour()</code>,
        <code>minute()</code> and <code>second()</code> commands, it is also
        possible to create custom time keeping algorithms. For some of my
        sketches I settled on defining a <code>frameRate</code> and subsequently
        using <code>millis()</code> to calculate a second using an
        <code>if</code> statement. I suspect there are so many more ways through
        which a second can be calculated. In the tap-to-speed-up-time prototype,
        a second is 20% slower than usual. This was done in an attempt to slow
        down time, and increase the sense of urgency when the button to speed up
        time is pressed.
      </p>

        Observing and studying time at close quarters is a fascinating
        experience. It felt like playing with the very fabric of existence, and
        it certainly does change how I think about time going forward. The
        ability to change the perception of time feels like magic, and it's
        something I will explore going forward.
