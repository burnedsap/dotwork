      <h1>Sky Globe</h1>

      <p>
        When I look up at the sky, I might see an airplane or two, but apart
        from a few rare sightings, the sky seems relatively empty. However, a
        quick glance at a (pre-COVID) flight schedule says anything but. Our
        skies are quite literally filled with airplanes, especially in a city
        with an airport. However, this data is quite difficult to visualise, let
        alone see even. Taking data from
        <a href="https://opensky-network.org/apidoc/index.html" target="_blank"
          >open-sky.org</a
        >, I created a Sky Globe which allows you to see the airplanes in the
        skies above your location.

        Sky Globe takes your location, and visualises the aircraft flying above
        you in real time. It shows all aircraft within an area of 295km around
        your location. Airplanes do fly awfully quickly, and a wider catchment
        area allows us to see aircraft that might be passing on the periphery of
        your location. The sketch also shows the visualisation of the altitude
        and traces the path of the aircraft as it passes through the sky. The
        position of the aircraft updates every 5.5 seconds. Each aircraft is
        marked with it's callsign and the country of origin. The information on
        display has been kept to a minimum to allows viewers to have a clear and
        unimpeded view of the visualisation.
      </p>
      <p>
        The sketch uses the
        <a href="https://opensky-network.org/apidoc/index.html" target="_blank"
          >open-sky</a
        >
        API to pull in aircraft coordinates and metadata. I have attemped to

        hidden activities in the skies above us. Not all aircraft flying are
        commercial, cargo, private, or military. Some aircraft have hidden
        agendas, often hidden behind false callsigns. This

          target="_blank"
          >article</a
        >
        elucidates one such incident. Websites such as
        <a href="http://flightaware.com" target="_blank">FlightAware</a> and
        <a href="https://www.flightradar24.com" target="_blank"
          >FlightRadar24</a
        >
        do show the aircraft in our vicinity, but it's difficult to visualise
        the data with a 2D visual. The source of the data is not clear with
        these commercial websites. The data on
        <a href="https://opensky-network.org/apidoc/index.html" target="_blank"
          >open-sky</a
        >
        is crowd-sourced, and hence aircraft cannot be hidden unless they switch
        off their ADS-B transponders (highly unlikely as they won't show up on
        ATC radar, which has major safety implications).
      </p>

      <p>
        Before creating the 3D version, I initially tried using a standard 2D
        version of the sketch which would reveal aircraft information on mouse
        hover.

        However, this variation wasn't very useful in displaying information as
        it didn't illustrate the position of the aircraft in relation to the
        viewer. The 3D view was important in conveying relative position of the
        aircraft in the sky.
      </p>
      <h2>
        Development
      </h2>

      <p>
        Developing this sketch was far more complicated than I initially
        imagined. There were a lot of moving parts, although mostly to do with
        the visualisation rather than navigating the API itself. One of the
        biggest challenges was creating the trails in the sky, as well has
        having <i>background refresh</i>. I used the same trick from the
        <a href="p9.html" target="_blank">Data Portrait</a> assignment. However,
        this meant that I had to develop a system to identify individual
        aircraft and update their locations without creating a new array of
        aircraft everytime. This was solved with a system of comparing two
        different arrays, and using <code>filter</code> to either remove or add
        aircraft as was required.
      </p>
      <p>
        Having figured out the data structures of the aircraft lists, I had to
        figure out how to create the trails for each aircraft, which would
        extend from the coordinates. I used a slightly complicated solution of
        creating two PVectors which would extend from the 3D coordinates to
        create each edge of the trail. This was needed as it would adapt to the
        rotation of the aircraft (another maths challenge to solve!) as it
        turned. Along the journey, I even made a case for, and advocated a

      <p>
        There are still unresolved issues with the sketch, which I haven't yet
        figured out how to solve. There appears to be a bizarre issue, where I
        can't seem to add (+) two variables. I'm utterly perplexed by this, and
        so I've used a hacky workaround to get around this issue. The other
        issue is that sometimes on manually entering coordinates, the API
        returns a null value. I can't figure out whether this means that there
        aren't any aircraft in the given area, or that there's something wrong
        with the API call itself. There appears to be no error message, so I'm
        assuming the 'null' refers to the lack of aircraft in the area.

        Reflections
      </h2>
      <p>
        This is perhaps the first sketch where the output genuinely surprised
        me. I wasn't expecting to see the visuals that I designed, perhaps
        because I didn't have any control over the data stream or the
        information displayed on the screen. I merely defined the rules, and the
        data stream does the rest. I do have a casual interest in aircraft and
        the aerospace industry, and so it was intersting to see the behaviours
        and patterns of aircraft around an airport. I could see the approach and
        departure patterns quite clearly from the visualisation!

        The process of visualisation of an open, yet difficult to visualise data
        source was satisfying. I realised that perhaps it wasn't so difficult to
        'see' the often hidden and unseen parts of our world. The data is
        available, I just need to put some effort into making it work for me!
