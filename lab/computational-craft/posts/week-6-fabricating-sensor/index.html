    <p>Fabricating copper traces on fabric is incredible and moves us from a breadboard board to proto-board or PCB level of finish. This particular trace is created with copper fabric cut by a vinyl cutter and stuck on a piece of cotton fabric. The circuit contains 2 LEDs, one regular and one SMD–the same with the resistors. Soldering these components was tricky and it takes a considerable amount of patience to solder the SMD parts on to the copper traces.</p>

<p>Once the traces were stuck on the fabric and the components were soldered, the edges of the fabric were sewn up to for a better finish and to provide easier access to the crocodile clips.</p>
<p>A resistive sensor was used to control the brightness of the LEDs.</p>

  Week 6 Soft Testing Board - Switch sketch

  Use this to test your vinyl cut or embroidered test board.
  To simplify, we do not have a pull down resistor
  on the switch pins, so we need to account for this in software.

  You can also use this board for a sensor but will need to adapt
  the mapping on the sketches from Week 4: https://github.com/lizastark/Teaching/tree/master/Comp_Craft/Week_4_Code

  Unlike pinMode(INPUT), there is no pull-down resistor necessary. An internal
  20K-ohm resistor is pulled to 5V. This configuration causes the input to read
  HIGH when the switch is open, and LOW when it is closed.

int topLED = 9;
int bottomLED = 6;
int switchPin = A0;

void setup() {
  //start serial connection
  Serial.begin(9600);
  //configure pin 2 as an input and enable the internal pull-up resistor
  pinMode(switchPin, INPUT_PULLUP);
  pinMode(topLED, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(bottomLED, OUTPUT);

}

void loop() {
  //read the sensor value into a variable
  int switchVal = analogRead(switchPin);
  //print out the value of the sensor mapped to the LED brightness
  Serial.println(map(switchVal, 670, 370, 0, 255));

  analogWrite(bottomLED, map(switchVal, 670, 370, 0, 255));
  analogWrite(topLED, map(switchVal, 670, 370, 0, 255));
