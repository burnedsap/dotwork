          <p>A key factor of the success of forests and other biomes on the planet is diversity. The higher the diversity, the more successful the entire biome is at surviving. Homogeneity is a slow killer. The different members in a biome are often complementary to each other, providing support in the form of resources or through symbiotic relationships.</p>
<p>Urban centers in human settlements are yet another example of diversity being a key factor in creating an exciting and progressive social dynamic. However, cities are still very homogeneous in their architectural makeup. The landscape of a city is sparse as compared to rural human settlements. A city is conducive for humans and other species which thrive off urban exhaust. Rats, pigeons, cockroaches, and others are just as welcome in a city.</p>
<p>This is an anamoly in the planetary pattern. Landscapes are usually fairly diverse, with a wide array of biotic and abiotic agents required to keep local systems functional.</p>
<p>Would planetary intelligences mandate diverse landscapes? What would human architecture look like if forced to adapt to heterogeneous settlements? Would machines enforce these boundaries and borders?</p>
