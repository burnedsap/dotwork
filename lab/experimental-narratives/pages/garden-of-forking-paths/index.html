            Description
          </h3>
          <p>
            The visual above shows the trajectory of the protagonist Yu Tsun,
            from the short story 'The Garden of Forking Paths', written by Jorge
            Luis Borges. The generative visual tracks the journey of Yu Tsun, as
            he attempts to convey information to his superiors back in Germany
            before he is captured by Captain Richard Madden. The black dot is Yu
            Tsun travelling as we follow his journey. We then see Richard Madden
            identified by the red dot in pursuit of Tsun. As Yu Tsun reaches the
            Garden of Forking Paths, we are then introduced to the idea of
            multiple narratives, which make themselves visible. We can see the
            many other paths Tsun could have potentially chosen. After, Richard
            Madden eventually catches up with Tsun, with the city of Albert
            clearly marked on the map.

            This mapping is not completely accurate, or the most informative.
            However, the generative nature of this piece has some consequences.
            The decision to make this piece generative was inspired by the story
            itself, and the generative nature of multiple narrative paths. We
            can clearly see Yu Tsun's journey as the reader is viewing the
            narrative through his eyes. Richard Madden's journey is not known to
            the reader, however his general whereabouts are made known, hence
            his path is not traced. The branching narratives are seen the moment
            Yu Tsun visits is made known of the text 'Garden of Forking Paths'.
            When Yu Tsun is eventually caught by Richard Madden, the city of
            Albert is marked on the visual. The city is recognised by the visual
            of a map created by the various branching narratives.
