            The overriding themes of the week were about the excessive amounts
            of food I was going to be eating, diwali diyas, the firecrackers,
            and the resulting air pollution I would have to escape from. A quick
            scoll through Instagram got me thinking of data exhaust, and so on
            the eve of Diwali I hatched a plan.
          </p>
          <p>
            I've outlined my thoughts in the presentation below, along with
            images of the physical model.
          </p>
          <p>
            <iframe
              src="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vRZdXooLObfuVljWF9K5dn9AjHlSyQzayKdvljYRNnW9SJTbWTwmHKWQW1LNtyuBSgakCeiVq5PsND_/embed?start=false&loop=true&delayms=3000"
              frameborder="0"
              width="100%"
              height="360"
              allowfullscreen="true"
              mozallowfullscreen="true"
              webkitallowfullscreen="true"
            ></iframe>
          </p>
          <p>
            The juxtaposition between the diyas and data was immediately
            apparent to me, but I had to work hard to not think beyond that. I
            knew that the learning was in the reflections <i>after</i> the fact,
            and so rather happily I approached the activity. It's not often that
            I get to do something fun, and call it work! I scraped out the wax
            from the spent diyas, melted them in a special double boiler, and
            poured them out (with immense wastage) into newer diyas and candles.
          </p>
          <p>
            There's a few things that came to mind when I was making the
            presentation and thinking back on the activity. I enjoyed the
            activity, and the process of reusing the 'waste' wax. It felt good
            to reuse and recycle resources to create something useful. There is
            a certain satisfaction in the performance, which I enjoyed. The
            physical effort felt nice. There was plenty to learn from the tools
            I used, and the method I used to melt and pour out the wax. I used
            tools that I found in my drawers or in the bathroom, and they aren't
            designed to pour out wax efficiently. The first batch I poured out
            was a messy process, and lots of wax either leaked or dripped out.
            The second time around, I was careful and delibrate in my methods,
            and as a result, there was minimal wastage.
