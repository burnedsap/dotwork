          <p>
            The medium is the message, is mistitled as medium is the massage,
            and the name stuck as Marshall thought it was apt. The underlying
            message of the writing is simple, the medium is more important than
            the message, or the content which it carries. The telephone is much
            bigger than just the call you make to your friend. Print is much
            more than just the printed word. Mass printing gave us the ability
            to disseminate information, which revolutionised the world. The
            telephone made the world a whole lot smaller, by making it easier to
            communicate with each other. Marshall writes that a medium is never
            neutral, and it does something to people. The telephone gave us the
            social convention of greeting each other with a ‘hello’ for example.
          </p>
          <p>
            The content is massaged by the medium. It’s interesting to see how
            content has evolved over time and been adapted to various mediums.
            For example, content which works well on the TV doesn’t translate
            well to the internet. People on Youtube prefer to watch home-made
            content, without any of the high production visual look of the
            content shown on the television. The medium defines the content it
            carries. For a while, Youtube limited free uploads to 10 min long
            videos, and as a result, many old videos are only that long. 10 mins
            is also the required length of video in order for them to be
            monetised, which reflects the content on the platform. This limit
            has been reduced to 8 mins, and so a change in the style of the
            content can already be seen. For a hammer, everything is a nail.

            A medium covers a broad range of things. It includes media such as
            radio, TV, social media, and even railways, or plastic bags. Each of
            these mediums enables something much larger, which has a significant
            impact on our lives. The railways for example, enabled the
            colonisation of India, and the economic pillaging of the
            subcontinent. However it also changed the way we have built cities
            and conduct trade. A plastic bag enabled the rise of convenient
            shopping, which created jobs, and revived economies.
          </p>
          <p>
            Looking back in time, mediums such as hand drawn animation, or
            analogue film-making which were traditionally used for mass media
            production, are now objects of nostalgia, and can often be found
            enshrined in museums and galleries the world over. Years after their
            obsolescence, they have created an entirely new industry of
            traditional craft, with their own unique aesthetic and visual style.
            The stories told through these mediums are far removed from what
            they were originally intended for.

            It’s important to understand Marshall’s intent behind this writing.
            He wrote the Medium of the Massage as an investigation, exploring
            his hypothesis, and not simply delivering his observations. The
            ‘Nut’ professor from Canada writes this piece, switching between an
            academic and a conversational style of writing, presenting his
            ideas. The Medium of the Massage outlines the impact of mediums on
            human society and culture. The mediums we use wire us differently,
            and it’s perhaps why succeeding generations are so adept at using
            newer technologies as they are exposed to it early on in their life.
