          <h1 class="post-title">Computing as a Resource v1</h1>
          <span class="post-date">23 Oct 2020</span>
          <p>
            I've always thought of computing as a resource, and with time, the
            significance of this resource keeps increasing. Although this isn't
            a novel thought, and has been widely discussed, I feel it doesn't
            get the attention it often deserves. To put things in perspective,
            even the most basic feature phone that can be purchased today has
            magnitudes more computing power than it took to put mankind on the
            moon. We take the power in our pockets for granted, usually unaware
            of the possibilities it holds for us. I use my smartphone to check
            my mail, browse social media, listen to some music, and perhaps play
            a few games. As a computer, it is completely wasted on me. As a
            computer, it is faster than my laptop, sips a third of it's power,
            and requires no active cooling. Don't forget, just 36 years ago, the
            first user friendly desktop Mac was launched, the Mac 128K. My
            smartphone is the utopic future the designers of the Mac 128K dreamt
            of.
          </p>

          <p>
            My ability to utilise my smartphone is a function of my own
            illiteracy. If I had the knowledge and the skills to communicate
            with my smartphone, and impress upon it my demands, I would be far
            more empowered in the world we live in. A large majority of our
            digital interactions are directly controlled, or influenced by a
            powerful few. The devices and platforms we use are largely
            restricted, and don't allow us to take advantage of the latent power
            within. The Raspberry Pi is a very interesting device in the context
            of the current digital infrastructures. Designed as a portable and
            hackable computer, the creaters of the Raspberry Pi encourage users
            to explore the technology and use it as they desire. The ecosystem
            around the Raspberry Pi is designed to educate and empower it's
            users.
          </p>

          <p>
            I have a Raspberry Pi along with a companion Astro Pi. The
            combination of these two devices gives users access to an array of
            sensors and computing power. I haven't had the chance to interact
            and play with my Pi, and so I decided to use to create something
            useful. A computer which would be functional, and work locally
            without depending on any external resources or libraries. The Astro
            Pi contains on it a temperature+humidity sensor, a joystick, and an
            LED array. I wrote some code (largely with the help of extensive
            tutorials) to display the temperature and humidity of my room on
            pushing the joystick.
          </p>
          <p>
            It's a very a simple computer, using simple sensors, and openly
            available code. Yet using this device felt far more empowering than
            any computer I have used before. The fact that this computer
            provides me with local and relevant information, using hackable
            hardware and software is poignant. Grand words for a device that
            costs no more than $35. But it helped me visualise how computing has
            value, even in its simplest form. It's this highly contextual and
            local value which is of particular interest for me. For sure,
            computing to decode viruses, or train machine learning models is
            perhaps more relevant and important today.
          </p>
          <p>
            But think of what happens when you scale up local computing and
            sensors. Imagine every household, and community creating their own
            digital networks which they define and control. What happens then?
            What if the smartphone in your pocket works with other smartphones
            in your neighbourhood to track data, and compute ideal solutions? This is just an initial exploration of the idea of local computing, and I intend to explore this in further detail.
