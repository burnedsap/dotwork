          <p>
            7 projects in 7 days was not an easy task, and in hindsight, the
            biggest challenge was perhaps navigating my own ideas and
            expectations. Left to my own devices, I probably could have very
            easily thought of ideas to work on, but the constraints of time, and
            the pressure to create something substantial left me perplexed. The
            first day started off well. I went for a walk in the morning with a
            friend, and through our discussions, a latent idea within me took
            shape. After breakfast, I started working on it, and by evening I
            had a functional prototype ready. From start to finish, I was in a
            flow, and I was looking forward to the next 6 days.
          </p>

          <p>
            However, the next day I found myself in a bit of a crisis. This was
            the crisis that would end up defining the week, and in retrospect,
            pushed me to interrogate myself. The day started off well. I woke up
            on time, ate breakfast, and soon I was at my desk with a pen and a
            notebook. But I couldn’t think of anything. The day before had gone
            well, with an idea I strongly believed in, and a working prototype.
            Any idea I had, I would compare to yesterday, and shoot it down.
          </p>

          <p>
            Then I really started thinking about the assignment, the nature of
            projects, my hobbies, and interesting lines of inquiry. I kept
            thinking about whether any project idea I thought of was only
            because I wanted to complete the assignment, or because I was
            actually interested in it. This led to an even scarier question–what
            was I interested in? What did I really want to do? What do I want?
            Paralysed with the lack of answers, I had to dig deep–with the aid
            of copious amounts of jasmine tea. I had a vague idea of what I was
            interested in, and perhaps wanted to do, but I’d never asked myself
            to dig deeper and question what was it exactly that I wanted. One of
            the reasons why I hadn’t asked myself this question was perhaps the
            fear of boxing myself into a corner or a specific line of work. I
            did not want to be shoehorned into any particular discipline, and I
            was fearful of doing so by defining my interests. This was the
            defining point of the week, and the conversations I had with myself
            would come to influence the projects I would work on in the coming
            days. By late evening I had drawn out large areas of interest, lines
            of inquiry, and skills I wanted to learn. This mapping helped me
            reassure myself that the project ideas I would subsequently think
            of, was driven by real interest, and not by a need to complete an
            assignment. I would often conflate the two, convincing myself of my
            supposed interest in an idea or a concept.
          </p>
          <p>
            Through this activity of frantically scribbling down my interests
            and thoughts, I also started to write down the questions I want to
            ask. Just like anyone else, I have many questions I keep asking of
            the world, in a quest to either critique it, or understand it
            better. However, I’ve started to notice a corruption of these
            questions by current events and the evolution of my own thoughts. It
            took a while for me to remember and recapture the lines of inquiry I
            find to be interesting from the flux. It was important that I had
            this moment, as it allowed me to focus on the right questions and
            concepts. The rest of the week was a lot less anxiety inducing after
            this mini-intervention with myself. Although it was still
            challenging to approach each day, and finish a project on time, I
            was confident that the projects were genuinely something I wanted to
            do.
          </p>
          <p>
            Looking back at the projects I worked on during the week, I see that
            many projects were a result of my anger and frustration with the
            status quo. 5 of 7 projects were driven by a desire to find new ways
            of doing things, or exploring new solutions. The other 2 projects
            were also driven by frustration, but this frustration was linked
            with a desire to learn new skills, or practice a craft, for which I
            don’t find enough time to do. Of the 5 projects driven by a desire
            to challenge current systems, I see a few broad themes. One of the
            themes is about reclaiming digital infrastructure. I’m concerned
            about the future of the internet, and digital technologies,
            especially in developing nations and communities with low digital
            literacy. A large part of the internet, digital services and
            platforms we interact with on a daily basis is controlled by a
            select few corporations, most of which are based in Silicon Valley.
            The design decisions made in these companies can be devastating, and
            they are complicit in not only influencing democratic elections, but
            also abetting genocides. I feel that there is a need to reclaim our
            spaces on the internet, and educate ourselves about digital
            technologies in order to understand what is happening in this space
            and to eventually create our own platforms. Although we are free to
            do so, and there is little to stop us, there is an explicit power
            equation in the development of digital technologies. A good example
            of this is the mass popularity of the Google Chrome browser (driven
            in large part by the default browser on Android smartphones), which
            gives Google the ability to influence the future of the internet.
          </p>

          <p>
            With the ‘Computing as a Resource v1’ and ‘नया Chatroom’ projects, I
            attempt to explore the possibilities of creating digital products
            which can one day be used by communities to create their own digital
            infrastructure, and reduce their dependence on corporations in
            Silicon Valley. In both these projects, I felt that the provocation
            was exciting, but the execution of the projects was poor. Especially
            with ‘Computing as a Resource v1’, I only had a few hours left to
            execute this, having spent the entire day on self-intervention. The
            project felt symbolic rather than functional. But through the making
            of the temperature reading code, I realised that there is something
            exciting about creating my own data. Instead of relying on websites,
            or government data even, there is value in creating data about my
            immediate surroundings. Now more than ever, this data is
            particularly useful, and can potentially be used to influence the
            future of my surroundings.
          </p>
          <p>
            The ‘नया Chatroom’ project explored the creation of alternate
            digital infrastructure, such as messaging platforms, which are
            primarily controlled by Facebook (in India-with Facebook Messenger,
            Whatsapp, and Instagram). Although I couldn’t make what I envisioned
            at the start of the day, I was excited about the idea, and the
            possibilities this could open up in different forms. While making
            the chatroom, I was thinking about local area network
            infrastructure, and what a ‘local internet’ would look like.
          </p>
          <p>
            Another theme that stood out to me, was that of culture and
            representation. The ‘Museum of Stolen Artifacts’ project was an
            attempt at creating a piece which would draw attention to the
            inequalities in representation of cultural artifacts, some of which
            can be attributed to legacy colonialism. Before starting this
            project, I knew very little about museums and the ownership of
            cultural artifacts, but through the process of creating the project,
            I developed strong opinions about the ownership of cultural
            artifacts. The systems and laws which help former colonists hold on
            to their loot, and use their plundered wealth to obtain cultural
            artifacts from other countries, are archaic and need to be reworked.
            A museum in the U.K., having ownership of artifacts obtained from
            India during the british colonial rule, and preventing anyone from
            accessing those artifacts is in my opinion completely wrong, and
            reinforces the power equations of the past. The ‘Digital Dioramas’
            project is another stab at the same, and this time exploring ways
            through which one can change the representation of culture online,
            and by extension, through digital media such as film, music, and
            interactive experiences. The internet provides us with a platform
            through which can change the visual culture and narrative of a
            culture.
          </p>
          <p>
            I was fairly happy with the execution of these projects, and felt
            that the prototypes were functional enough to be effective in
            communicating the underlying message. However, I do feel that I need
            to sharpen my concepts before I start making something. Often I feel
            like I’m changing my own questions and parameters through the
            process of making.
          </p>
          <p>
            Two of the seven projects can be classified as skill building
            exercises, or perhaps more accurately, rest days on which I took a
            small break in order to focus on something fun. For me, learning a
            new skill is just as frustrating as it is fun, and I’d be doing
            nothing else if I had a choice. ‘Toothpaste Driven Cars’ was a
            project in which I just wanted to focus on my fear of drawing, and
            the desire to practice something without the pressure of having to
            deliver, either to a client or any kind of expectations. I haven’t
            given myself the liberty or the time to do so, and as a result I
            find myself only practicing and designing when I need to deliver
            under pressure. However, I did feel that I was disappointed in
            myself at the end of the day, and I wasn’t happy with the quality of
            work. I appreciated the activity, but wasn’t happy with the output.
          </p>
          <p>
            In contrast, the last day’s project, ‘Flight Simulator’ was a true
            dive into the unknown, and I was fully prepared to fail. I wanted to
            explore the medium of game engines through the lens of my favourite
            gaming genre, flight simulators, with no expectations of creating
            anything useful or playable. The journey was to be the learning for
            the day. Not having any expectations was refreshing and I found
            myself enjoying the challenge of trying to figure out a new
            software, and a new coding language.
          </p>
          <p>
            This leads me to what I felt was the overarching challenge of the
            activity: my mental state. The projects, their success, and my
            experience of working on them was a result of my mental state. This
            might seem blindingly obvious, but everyday started with a debate
            with myself, trying to figure out the brief, the process, and my
            expectations. I was also thinking about others expectations. I knew
            I would be presenting the work, and so I was actively aware of the
            fact that I had to perform, not only for myself, but for an
            audience. But I deeply appreciated these internal debates in my
            brain, as it gave me the opportunity to refocus, and clear the fog
            that had accumulated. My approach toward work is slightly calmer
            than it was a week ago.
