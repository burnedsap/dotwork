            An early morning walk with a friend led to a discussion of culture
            and museums. As someone who studied exhibition design, I've always
            loved the idea of museums, but I also see their insignificance in
            todays world. Not only are they out of touch with their visitors,
            but also serve to remind us of an era they used to exist in. Museums
            are a great way to see and experience culture and heritage, and not
            just read about them in a book. But lately, I've been thinking about
            the artifacts on display in the museums and their significance.
          </p>

          <p>
            Story time: I worked on a trans-media project called Antariksha
            Sanchar, which is a video game+theatrical
            performance+documentation+digital project inspired by the cultural
            heritage of Tamil Nadu. During the british colonial rule,
            documentation of the culture at the time was scarce, and not much in
            the way of visual documentation exists. The V&A museum in the U.K.
            has in its collection, a series of illustrations of the people
            during that time. This documentation of that particular time period
            is especially valuable since not much exists. To access these
            paintings, one must visit the V&A website to view the collection. On
            doing so, the viewer is presented with this:
          </p>

              src="https://cdn.glitch.com/40187183-5e4e-484a-90d9-bebecde392bf%2FScreenshot%202020-10-22%20at%209.02.11%20PM%20(2).png?v=1603442222920"
              alt="V&A Illustrations"
            />
          </p>

          <p>
            The very fact that the documentation of Indian culture and heritage
            is owned by it's former colonial rulers is shocking. The
            restrictions placed on its use by a mere museum in a foreign land is
            a bizarre concept, and one that I refuse to abide by. These rights
            on someone else's culture are meaningless and harmful. Why is it
            that someone in India must learn of their own culture and heritage
            by accessing the museum of a former colonial power?
          </p>

            Of course, this is just the tip of the proverbial iceberg, with the
            British Museum in London, having in its collection artifacts which
            have been <i>stolen</i> from countries around the world. The
            acknowledgement of the fact isn't enough, and these items must be
            returned. This video essay by Vox,

            explains this in greater detail. For those who'd like a more
            entertaining take on the same, the

            In response to this, I've created the
            <b>Museum of Stolen Artifacts</b> or <b>MSA</b> in short. It's a
            museum that lives on the internet, and when opened shows you where
            the artifacts are originally from. I strongly believe that artifacts
            must belong to their home countries, and must only be loaned to the
            other museums. The outright ownership of an artifact cannot be of a
            foreign country. The <b>MSA</b> is a museum that shows the viewer
            the origin of an artifact, and intents to press home the fact that
            they do not belong in certain institutions.

            is (preferably) to be used on a smartphone, which uses the primary
            camera to detect objects via a tensorflow powered machine-learning
            algorithm. On detecting the object, the MSA will show the user the
            name of the artifact, and the country of origin. Although it's
            currently a protoype, and only works with 3 artifacts on display at
            the British Museum. Future updates to the project will include
            further information such as the history of the object, and ownership
            details, along with the ability to recognise far more objects than
            it does so currently.
          </p>

            Below are some images and videos of the initial prototype.
