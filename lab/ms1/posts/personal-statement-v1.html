          <p>
            Of the many things that I am currently interested in, I have
            particularly enjoyed re-contextualising technology for use in
            low-technology settings. The cutting edge of technology is just as
            fascinating as re-using old technology in new settings. This also
            ties in with my belief of having an equitable playing field in
            regard to the access and use of technology. Developing nations and
            certain communities are deprived of access to technology, and hence
            find themselves at the wrong end of the power spectrum in the
            digital era. Access and education of digital technology is becoming
            increasingly important and can be a conduit for social mobility.
            There is a need to make technology more accessible, but critically
            make it so that the people using the technology are also the ones
            creating it, or influencing it. We have seen instances of tech
            giants such as Facebook using the naivety and ignorance of people in
            developing countries for their own interests and profits, which has
            to lead to the corruption of democracy and genocide. There is a dire
            need to reclaim the power of technology to voice our opinions, and
            use it for our benefit. How might we reclaim the power of digital
            technology to benefit those who often find themselves being taken
            advantage of in the digital realm. This includes not only the
            technology itself, but with related policy, laws, ethics, and
            frameworks. Just like the industrial age, some countries find
            themselves at an advantage as compared to others in the digital era,
            and used their power to colonise and pillage wealth. This must not
            happen again. In the digital age, it’s not just nations fighting for
            supremacy, but communities within nations which are finding
            themselves at a disadvantage as compared to others.
          </p>

          <p>
            Technologies which we consider to be simple, or mature are still
            cutting edge in many contexts, and can be used to great effect. The
            use of the technology, and it’s purpose must be defined by the
            community which will end up using it. But most of this technology is
            difficult to access and set up. Just as p5js and glitch made the web
            a lot more accessible and functional, there is scope to create
            technology which can be used to level the playing field, and equip
            newcomers with the tools and knowledge they need to not only
            survive, but thrive in the digital era.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Some examples</b>
          </p>

          <p>
            How might we use widely accessible technologies such as SMS, IVRS to
            help people in rural India to _________________ (monitor intake of
            medicine, track food/fuel prices, access government subsidies,
            improve community participation, manage finances, etc). Can a simple
            local area network be used to coordinate trade within communities?
            Can mini solar grids be used to tokenize and sell power to
            neighbouring communities?
