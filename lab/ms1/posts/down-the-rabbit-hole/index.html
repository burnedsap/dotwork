            I've always wondered how far I can travel on
            <a href="http://youtube.com" target="_blank">Youtube</a>. If I spent
            enough time on the platform with the intention of getting lost,
            where would I end up? Unfortunately, I haven't had the time to spend
            a whole doing so, and Youtube's algorithms are quite good at keeping
            me in my content circle. I also want to document and quanitfy this
            journey across the Youtube landscape to see the inflections points
            within the journey. When does the content start to dramatically
            change? Does the content ever break out of the grasp of the
            recommendation engine? Will I encounter some strange as yet unseen
            content? Only one way to find out.
          </p>

          <p>
            A few years ago I had tried a similar experiment, but without the
            pointed rigour or technical know-how. Armed with some basic Python,
            and advanced search skills, I set about trying to figure out how I
            would traverse across the platform, all while documenting my
            journey. The idea was simple enough. Open a video on Youtube, and
            then click on the video under 'Up Next' on the right side of the
            screen. Repeat and record the metadata, and a screenshot of each
            video. I hacked together a quick little Selenium powered Python
            script, which would store all the data within a <i>CSV</i> file.
          </p>
          <p>
            <img
              src="https://cdn.glitch.com/40187183-5e4e-484a-90d9-bebecde392bf%2Fyoutube-pull-1.png?v=1603792433664"
              alt="work in progress"
            />
          </p>
          <p>
            However, I immediately ran into a strange problem. For reasons I
            don't understand the videos would either repeat or only 2 videos
            would play one after another. I assume this has to do either do with
            my script, or a strange behaviour of Youtube's algorithms.
          </p>
          <p>
            <img
              src="https://cdn.glitch.com/40187183-5e4e-484a-90d9-bebecde392bf%2Fyoutube-pull-2.png?v=1603792508755"
              alt="first attempt"
            />
            <i>First attempt</i>
          </p>

          <p>
            To get around this issue, I changed the code so that it would select
            any video from the suggestions on the right hand side. This helped
            fix the problem, and during my testing, I also figured out a way to
            get metadata such as a title, views, tags, and the thumbnail from
            the video. In the previous iteration, the screenshot would often
            capture an image of the ad, and not the video. With the new
            algorithm set up, I took another shot at travelling across the
            internet.

              alt="new code"

              alt="new progress bar"
            />
            <i>Added a progress bar</i>
          </p>
          <p>
            The first run wasn't too spectacular, with the content of the videos
            staying relatively within the same genre and kind of content. A 100
            iterations doesn't appear to be enough to derail or test the
            algorithm.

            I tried 300 iterations on the next attempt. This time the results
            were a little more interesting. Right towards thre end there were a
            few videos which weren't very popular, evident by their view count.
            Another longer run would be needed to explore this.

            Each website visit takes about 10 seconds, which includes an induced
            delay to make sure the website loads properly. So 500 iterations
            would take approximately 1.5 hours, maybe more depending how the CPU
            load.

          <p>
            The last run with 500 iterations did not produce any noteworthy results, perhaps due to the expansive nature of gaming content. Perhaps more runs are needed, with diverse topics and 
          </p>
          <p>
            The results may not be as satisfying as I'd have wanted them to be,
            but it's an interesting research process, and the <i>CSV</i> format
            is conducive to creating an interactive website from the data.
