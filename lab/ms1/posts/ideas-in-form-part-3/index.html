            As I sat on my desk, and stared at the only slide that made any
            sense to me, I realised that I was still lost, and didn't have a
            clue on how to proceed. I still had much to explore and research
            before I could even start thinking of a solution. I was a fair bit
            more excited by the polar opposite of my question, than the intended
            answer to said question.

            The only thing I could do at this point, was to continue exploring
            and researching this topic further. Except this week, I was blessed
            with a constraint: using digital media. I fired up a trusty 3D
            modelling software and started sketching some ideas in three
            dimensions. My intent was to visualise objects/artefacts of healthy
            technology for each of my three personas I had constructed earlier.
          </p>
          <p>
            The first persona was someone who wanted to take back control of
            their digital life, and define it's impact on their life. This is
            someone for whom notifications are unsolicited, unconsented
            interruptions.

            As I started modelling in 3D, I was drawn to an idea of box, a
            faraday cage of sorts, which would give the user tools to control
            and tame the digital technology in their lives.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Faraday Box</b>
          </p>

              >A simple wooden box, passed down from generation to generation,
              which allows for the control of digital presence in the space.
              Made of rosewood, the box is highly resilient to ravages of time,
              and uses the tried and trusted faraday cage along with a
              controlled electromagnetic wave generation device to influence the
              space around it. The user can choose their desired settings with
              the easy to use milled aluminium dial and the retro LCD display.
              Custom settings can be dialled in with the NFC strip on the top
              case.

              alt="Faraday Box"
            />
          </p>
          <p>
            As I was creating the box, and sculpting it, ideas for various
            features and capabilities came to mind. The making of the Faraday
            Box was as much a design research method as it was a design output
            or result. This process of making was very useful in my search of
            meaning.
          </p>
          <p>
            I also created a small product poster in the hopes of exploring this
            thought of learning by making further. While designing the poster, I
            added the fact that the box was made out of rosewood, and hence was
            made in Pakistan. I wonder what it means to have digital technology
            products designed and manufactured in places we don't usually
            associate with technical expertise.
          </p>

            To accompany the <b>Faraday Box</b>, I created a Network Panel,
            which would help the user control their digital platforms with a
            massive screen and large tactile buttons.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Network Panel</b>

            <i>
              A must-have for any home, the network panel allows the user to
              have complete control over their digital community with the touch
              of a few (real) buttons. The non-touch interface and arcade style
              buttons affords for a healthy distance between the user and the
              content. With it’s low-attention grade and limited connectivity,
              it’s the perfect choice for the discreet digital native.

            />
          </p>
          <p>
            The thought of using large analogue buttons to control digital
            technology appealed to me. Reducing digital interfaces to mere
            buttons is wrong, yet it brings back control in our hands, quite
            literally.

            The next persona I designed for, was a RWA (Residents Welfare
            Association) committee head. This person manages a condominium, and
            has to ensure that the infrastructure is working well.

            our data, which can be used for detailed analysis and put to
            functional use.

            The last and the most exciting persona on this list is a social
            media troll. This is a person who is paid to generate and co-opt
            social media trends for the benefit of their paying clients. This
            isn't a speculative persona by any means, with many social media
            experts currently employed various organisations to mould and shape
            trends on social media. I specifically want to look at those folks
            who are hired to corrupt, destroy, or hijack trends, usually for
            facist organisations, such as the current ruling party of India, the
            BJP–<i>which happens to have an IT Cell which does exactly this</i
            >–or any other political or private organisation.

            I created a set of professional grade tools meant for social media
            trolls. Just as a racing car is solely designed to go fast around a
            track, or a stockbroker's networking set up is designed to reduce
            latency, the MediaControl Studio Pro™️ is designed for social media
            trolls who are on the top of their game. It's interesting to think
            of designing for–<i>at least on the face of it</i>–such an overtly
            negative persona. But this does make for an interesting lens to look
            at the world of technology through. Inspired by tools designed for
            music producers and DJ's, the MediaControl Studio Pro™️ give the
            social media troll full access to all the parameters they would
            likely need at their fingertips.
          </p>
          <p>
            I forsee these tools initially marketed towards social media
            professionals such as brand managers and campaign managers to help
            them control a vast social media presence. However, social media
            trolls would eventually hack the devices to serve their own
            "<i>nefarious</i>" purposes. I would assume this inflection point
            could be summed up in an arrogant tweet, proclaiming victory over
            the established order of technology.

            campaigns across various platforms from a single interace. Two
            indicators over each key can be individually programmed to report on
            the progress of each campaign. The control dials on the top can be
            used to tweak parameters such as tone, volume, investment and reach,
            among other custom variables.

            The ToneMapper™️ is a great way to quickly and easily control the
            mood of your social media posts. The large dial allows the user to
            control to switch up emotions on the fly, to pivot social media
            campaigns. Moods can either be preprogrammed, or the default
            spectrum can be used. The in-built LCD screen keeps you informed of
            the selected mood. The brushed aluminium finish is designed to
            withstand years of use without any signs of wear or tear.

            The process of constructing these objects was as critical as the
            outputs. As I sculpted these objects, I started to think of more
            ideas, which I then incorporated into the objects. I also spoke to a
            social media professional to understand the various ways in which
            their tasks could be subverted for nefarious purposes. I enjoyed the
            process of creating these objects, and I feel like I've learnt a lot
            while doing so. It's always refreshing to break out of my thinking
            bubble and drive down the wrong side of the highway for a while.

            As a thank you for reading this post all the way through, here's a
            picture of a cat I've been thinking of through this project. There's
            something so riveting about this image, I can't quite put my paw on
            it...
