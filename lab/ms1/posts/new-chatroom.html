          <p>
            Of the many forms of communication, I enjoy text messaging the most.
            Although it appears to be very simple, there's a fair bit of
            complexity involved in the activity. One of the reasons why I enjoy
            this medium is that I get to think and take my time while expressing
            my thoughts. I have the freedom to edit myself, and structure my
            responses. I especially need to self-edit, as I tend to think too
            quickly and as a result I often lose my train of thought. Text is a
            wonderful medium of expression, with multiple ways to format
            messages in order to convey thought.
          </p>

          <p>
            The rituals of text messaging have evolved with time, and have
            become a lot more complex. The platforms and digital infrastructure
            needed to have a secure text messaging conversation has also added
            further complexity. Most of our daily messaging is on platforms
            owned by a single corporation–Facebook. Putting aside the wildly
            critical notions of platform monopolies, surveillance, and data
            ownership, text messaging platforms have also become quite
            monolothic. It's nothing like the good old days spent on IRC
            chatrooms. Platforms like etherpad are very interesting as it brings
            some of the freedom of expression back to text messaging.
          </p>

          <p>
            A few months ago, I was a participant of a workshop facilitated by
            Xin Xin and Lark VCR which taught me how to create custom chatrooms.
            It uses FeatherJS, hosted on a Glitch server, and the code template
            allowed me to quickly create and edit my very own chatroom. The
            power to create and control my own communication space on the
            internet! Oh the freedom! This is a very novel experience for me,
            and perhaps for most people on the internet. The ability to create
            my own infrastructure is very satisfying.
          </p>
          <p>
            This also affords me the ability to define the experiences within
            this chatroom. I want to experiment and create new kinds of chatroom
            experience, which are conducive to storytelling and communication
            via text. Simple text formatting, such using higher weights,
            capitalisation, or italicising the text are powerful in their own
            right. Although using emoji, adding random variables, and gamifying
            the experience can make this a fun chatroom. A chatroom which breaks
            the current visual and semantic norms simply because its fun to do
            so, and it can.
          </p>
          <p>
            For example, the words 'Neue', or 'Pro' and more are used to
            differentiate products-BORING. Why not using other languages? I've
            used 'नया'. It means new, but it sounds better and is different.
            Breaking the homogeneity of the internet is a critical part of this
            chatroom's identity.
          </p>
          <p>
            Access the chatroom <a href="https://naya-chatroom.glitch.me" target="_blank">here</a>!
          </p>
          <p>
            This is still very much a prototype, and things keep breaking!
          </p>
