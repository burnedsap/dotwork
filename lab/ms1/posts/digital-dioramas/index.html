            Of the many crusades I have currently embarked on, the one of
            digital representation is quite important for me. Communities and
            cultures are not represented the way they'd like to be on the
            internet, especially with regard to documentation and media. This is
            particularly important for developing nations. A quick search for
            <i>'Afghanistan houses 3D'</i> reveals structures primarily seen in
            video games such as Call of Duty or Counter-Strike, which is
            emphatically not a true representation of the country or its
            culture.

            I strongly feel there is a need to document and disseminate heritage
            and culture online that helps create an accurate representation of
            people and communities. This hasn't been possible for a long time as
            technologies and tools that allow for the creation of media have
            only been accessible by countries which are far richer (read: former
            colonialists). It's strange to think that a game designer in the
            U.S. creating 'Afghani' assets has been able to influence
            generations (plural) in their perception of a country and cultures.

            Photogrammetry is one such tool which can help balance the
            inequality of access and power of digital representation. It's a
            technique that allows for the creation of high fidelity 3D models
            using nothing but traditional 2D photographs and a computer.
            Previously, prohibitively expensive 3D scanners and the respective
            skillsets were needed to create 3D models. But now, even I can make
            3D models with nothing more than a smartphone and low-end laptop
            like a MacBook Air.
          </p>

            And so I did. I wanted to create small digital dioramas, to capture
            a scene, a place, a moment in time. A small scene meant to express a
            particular place. Using a combination of 3D, animation and sound to
            capture an experience. Every alternate day I visit a relatively
            unknown park in my city, which is a 5km walk from my house. It's
            about a 10km round trip to visit this hidden gem. Within this gem of
            a park there's a well, and a little shed. I like the feeling of
            sitting near the well, and just taking some time to enjoy being
            alone in a pocket of nature.
          </p>
          <p>
            I started the process by taking photos of the space with my
            smartphone. I would use these images as the source data for the
            photogrammetry process. In all, I took about 105 images.
          </p>
          <p>
            <img
              src="../glitch-assets/IMG_20201027_090711.jpg"
              alt="the well"
            />

              alt="photos of the well"
            />
          </p>
          <p>
            I used a software called Metashape to process these images to create
            a 3D model. This took quite a long time. More than half a day
            infact, and my laptop was completely unusable while it calculated a
            3D model through the images.

          <p>
            I used a few preset trees, and after a lot more time unsuccessfully
            attempting to animate the trees in a natural manner, and failing to
            upload the resulting model to Sketchfab due to size issues, I
            resigned myself to simply rendering a 2D image of the diorama using
            Cinema4D. The intent was to create an audio-visual piece which would
            be representative of my experience of the space. But due to severe
            technical limitations and the lack of skills, I was unable to create
            it. A 2D render will have to do for now.
