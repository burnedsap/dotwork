            The internet and the onset of affordable consumer digital
            technologies promised us a new and limitless world, where we could
            make new rules and exist how we see fit. However, that never quite
            happened. Just like in the real world, those in power, and those in
            control of the technology quickly took control of digital
            technologies, and designed them in order to reinforce their position
            in power. Back in the early days, when dial-up internet, and Windows
            95 was all the rage, the internet was evolving rapidly, and the
            landscape would change every time I logged on. Metaphorically, it
            felt like a wide, open, and largely empty landscape, and you had to
            know which websites to visit in order to visit places on the
            internet. Today, it feels like a collection of large cities, where
            most people can be found at, and desolate land between the cities.
            The internet is largely controlled by a few organizations and
            people, who by extension of their control, also end up defining the
            future of technology. The cycle of power simply augments these
            organizations, which gives them even more power.
          </p>

            I wouldn’t have ever imagined that Facebook, a website, would end up
            facilitating the corruption of a democracy, or the genocide of
            communities. The internet has outgrown the digital realm, and in
            many cases, wields more power than most nations. Many of these
            corporations were founded and headquartered in the U.S., and as such
            have a certain kind of people who make the decisions, which will
            eventually impact the lives of someone living halfway across the
            world. The butterfly effect is very real, and can be seen in real
            time. Google, Facebook and Microsoft have passed ‘policies’ so to
            say, in the way that they conduct their businesses, and govern their
            platforms. These ‘policies’ have far more impact than most
            governments do. With the fluid, and elastic nature of the internet
            and digital technologies, any kind of change can have a massive
            impact on the people who use the internet and digital technologies.

            I’m concerned about the lack of control and influence over the
            technologies we use. The power to design our technology, and by
            extension, our future, is in the hands of a select few. Big Tech is
            indeed too big, and has a disproportionate amount of power. With the
            digital realm becoming ever more important, it’s critical that we
            the people understand how technology works, and how we can either
            influence the design of the technologies we use, or create our own.
            This is easier said than done, as can be witnessed with several
            technology development programmes around the world. India for
            example, is grappling with designing and manufacturing custom
            central processing units (CPU), a critical component of creating
            home-grown computer hardware. It’s also been interesting to see
            North Korea develop systems to support the country without external
            influences. There’s a balance to be maintained between exclusionary
            practices and mass centralization, and that starts with wanting to
            reclaim the technology we use, and the power it brings with it.
          </p>
          <p>
            There’s a few questions that catalysed my thinking about reclaiming
            technology. I’ve always wondered, what would the world look like if
            it wasn’t designed in large part by former colonialists, and the
            West? What would the internet be like if it was designed in India?
            Would digital communication look any different if it was
            conceptualized by people in Central Asia? Erring to the extreme,
            what would smartphones look like if they were designed by religious
            fanatics? Some questions are more sane than others, but they are all
            equally valid in my point of view. It’s difficult to even think of
            answers to these questions, because it’s difficult to imagine places
            other than Silicon Valley, and the like, designing technology that
            people across the world use.
          </p>
          <p>
            There is one case study which is interesting, and sheds light on the
            monopolisation of technology. When the U.S. government stopped
            American companies from supplying technology to Chinese companies,
            Huawei was adversely affected. Although they are unique in the way
            that they design and manufacture their own computing hardware
            (primarily smartphones), they use Google’s Android operating system.
            With this ban by the U.S. government, Huawei was forced to start
            developing its own operating system for their smartphones, in order
            to offer a compelling product. Depending on where you lie on the
            political spectrum, this may seem silly, or a crushing victory for
            the U.S., but it does lead to the possibility of Huawei developing
            an operating system designed for their customers (primarily in China
            and Asia), which could potentially end being far better in these
            markets. I for one, am very curious to see the development of the
            upcoming Harmony OS. A brand new, homegrown smartphone operating
            system designed primarily for Chinese and Asian users is a very
            exciting proposition in the current duopolistic market.
          </p>

          <p>
            It’s not just smartphone owners, and people in the tech industry who
            could benefit from dismantling the current technology. There’s
            people on the other end of the spectrum who could greatly benefit
            from this as well. It’s been a few years since Facebook launched a
            massive campaign to convince the people of India to buy into their
            plan of providing free internet, with strings attached of course.
            The advertising blitz spoke about the possibility of ‘free’ internet
            and the ability to use Facebook without data charges. Luckily, the
            government saw through the deception, and they weren’t allowed to
            set up what was quite clearly an attempt to corrupt net neutrality
            rules in India. For me this situation was quite interesting. There
            were people who were supporting Facebook’s initiative because it
            would give ‘free’ internet access to many who couldn’t afford it
            before. As it happened, data rates fell dramatically due to fierce
            competition in the telecom industry, and now India has the lowest
            data rates of any country in the world. This ‘competition’ in itself
            deserves to be unpacked and explored further, but the root issue is
            the difficulty for many people in accessing the internet and digital
            technology. It is critical that we bridge the gap between demand and
            supply, but on the right terms, and on conditions that are
            beneficial to the users. The promise of emancipation and progress
            often brings with it the acceptance of certain compromises which
            disproportionately affect certain people and communities.
          </p>
          <p>
            I see a need to reclaim the power to create and shape technologies
            for ourselves, for the people, by the people. We need to create
            technologies that are highly contextual, and are designed
            specifically for the context and people where it is being used. This
            could take any given form, perhaps a local area network, which helps
            communities work together, or community data collection centers,
            which creates local data to help governments make decisions. This
            could also take the form of education, awareness, and formal
            training. Although the idea of ‘local’ technologies and its
            potential applications are quite exciting, I mustn’t discard the
            dangers high levels of fragmentation could bring. Technologies need
            to be developed in a holistic manner, using commonly used open
            source platforms which allow for communication between communities.
          </p>
          <p>
            The phrase, ‘healthy technologies’ often comes to mind. The thought
            of starting from scratch, and building afresh is very exciting, and
            I wonder what decisions will be made in the conceptualising of new
            technologies. It’s possible that we may end up with the same kind of
            technology, with similar rules, and similar power structures.
          </p>
          <p>
            I don’t know what these reclaimed technologies could look like, but
            I’m very much looking to find out. Local intranets are a good place
            to look for references and examples of custom local technology.
            Intranets are in essence, localised internets which have their own
            rules, and ways of networking. Just like google.com, or facebook.com
            are places to visit on the internet, there are certain websites only
            available on intranets where people congregate on, or files and
            folders which people often access. It’s very interesting to see
            different rituals that have come about as a result of new kinds of
            interaction and information that comes with an intranet.

            Bristol, a city in the United Kingdom is a ‘smart-city’ which uses a
            multitude of sensors to help the city make decisions about traffic,
            utilities, and future developments. The creation of more data points
            to help maintain the health of a city is very interesting. The data
            empowers the city to make the right decisions, without having to
            rely on the existing nationwide network which isn’t as accurate.
          </p>

            The Raspberry Pi is a great example of a cheap computing device
            which can be used for a variety of purposes. It’s ability to adapt
            to different kinds of hardware, and ease with which it can be
            programmed makes it a great platform to create local technologies.
            George Hotz, the creator of commaai, an open source self driving
            hardware/software stack has been actively creating his own
            technology. His most recent project, tinygrad, is a small neural
            network that runs on a Mac+AMD GPU’s (platforms traditionally
            shunned by ML). He’s also developed a 12 week learning module to
            teach people the basics of a transistor all the way to working with
            an FPGA board.

            With the advent of machine learning applications, the divide between
            the technologically engaged and those who are not will only deepen.
            It’s important that we right the ship and give people the
            opportunity to empower themselves with technology.
