            Game engines are interesting platforms to play with. Their ability
            to create simulations of reality pushes me to experiment with
            different models of the world. What would the world be like if
            gravity was a little wonky? Or how would everything appear if the
            sun emitted a very narrow spectrum of light? It plays into my
            fascination of speculative worlds and day dreaming, and makes my
            thoughts actionable. Game engines are also difficult to master, and
            require a mastery over code to truly make something spectacular.
            Unity and Unreal Engine, two of the biggest platforms require the
            user to have an in-depth knowledge of the C# programming language,
            which can get quite verbose. These engines are also behemoths,
            require a minimum of 5GB of space, and oodles of compute power to
            run smoothly. For someone who doesn't have a professional grade
            computer, they are often inaccessible.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Godot game engine is a unique alternative to the regulars in the
            space. It only requires a total of 75MB, and not much is needed in
            way of computing power to experiment and play with it. It uses a
            scripting language, which is similar in structure to C#, but much
            simpler to work with. I've been wanting to get started with this
            game engine and understand how it works, and so I collected a few
            tutorials, downloaded the software and got cracking. I enjoy making
            physics simulations, primarily because its generative in nature, and
            it's fun to work with the constraints of physics-and break them!
            Flight simulators and racing games are my favourite genre of games.
            I remember diving into the code of Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit 2, to
            change gear rations, dampner rates, and modulate brake balance to
            see the effects it would have on the character of the vehicle. I
            could spend days doing nothing but constantantly tweaking tiny
            values to achieve a specific goal. The iterative process of the
            activity is meditative.
          </p>
          <p>
            Flight simulators are very difficult to make, and it's no surprise
            that there aren't made as often. The closest I could hope to get to
            one within a span of a day is to create an arcade simulation, which
            would look and feel similar to a flight simulator, without any of
            the complex physics calculations. This seemed like an ideal goal to
            start learning Godot with. Sky Rogue, one the best games I've played
            in a long time uses a similar strategy.

            I started my Godot journey. As expected, it was initially quite
            challenging as I figured out the interface, and the structure of the
            software. Unlike Unity, Godot is quite barebones, and requires a far
            bit of understanding of the interface to create something very
            basic. But before I could write a line of code, I needed a plane. So
            I created one using Cinema4D.
          </p>
          <p>
            <img
              src="https://cdn.glitch.com/40187183-5e4e-484a-90d9-bebecde392bf%2FScreenshot%202020-10-28%20at%201.12.17%20PM.png?v=1603883706376"

          </p>
          <p>
            Although the coding part wasn't so lengthy, with only a single
            script, the challenge was in putting everything together and
            troubleshooting the problems I was facing. At first my plane was
            completely skewed, with none of the controls responding. The scene
            was far too dark, and I couldn't figure out how to place objects in
            the scene.
          </p>

            <img

              alt="First iteration"
            />
          </p>
          <p>
            It took some time, and after a fair bit of frustration, it started
            to come together. I figured out how to place elements, add lights,
            and get all the elements to line up properly. The code, although
            simple in it's logic took a bit of time to completely understand, in
            order to fix the strange issues. But soon, I got it working as
            intended!
          </p>
          <p>
            <img
              src="https://cdn.glitch.com/40187183-5e4e-484a-90d9-bebecde392bf%2FScreenshot%202020-10-28%20at%204.03.19%20PM.png?v=1603883703960"
              alt="second iteration"
            />
          </p>
          <p>
            Not everything was perfect thought. I really wanted to implement a
            keyboard and gamepad controller, but I couldn't quite figure it out.
            The trails also don't quite work so well disconnecting when the
            plane turns. The behaviour of the plane itself isn't as satisfying
            as I'd have liked it to be, with inconsistent controls on the outer
            envelopes.
          </p>

              alt="final code"

          </p>
          <p>
            But I'm happy to have started my journey into using Godot, and
            hopefully creating my own flight simulator down the line.
