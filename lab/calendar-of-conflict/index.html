          Calendar of Conflict
        </h1>
        <p>
          The Calendar of Conflict is a data-driven inquiry into the year of
          2019 to uncover the hidden points of conflict by analysing the news. A
          continuously evolving project, it aims to map the important events and
          trends by filtering through the noise of the news. Using semantic
          analysis, and keyword tagging, events of conflict have been pulled out
          from the corpus of news data, which can be accessed via an interactive
          experience. The intent is to show that news isn’t all that it seems to
          be, and that we should be aware of the conflicts that happen everyday
          unseen.

            The ways in which we consume news and understand the happenings of
            our environment have changed with the advent of smartphones and
            mobile connectivity. The onslaught of news and information is mind
            numbing, and fatiguing. It is often difficult to process how the
            world around us really is, and put the things we read into context.
            In this new paradigm driven by the attention economy, media sources
            often resort to grabbing the reader’s attention using exaggerated
            and misleading titles to get them to click and get more views.
          </p>
          <p>
            The news media has also become increasingly political, and their
            ability to hold the attention of their audience hasn’t escaped those
            in power. News cycles are often used by governments and those in
            power to draw attention away from the bigger issues to escape public
            scrutiny. Some Indian news media outlets have been vital to the
            Narendra Modi led government in keeping the public enthralled with
            divisive issues while those in power get away with undemocratic
            behaviour. In 2020, the death of a Bollywood actor Sushant Singh
            Rajput was used to distract public attention away from India’s
            shrinking economy and poor response to the COVID-19 Pandemic. Many
            in India truly believe that India is free from any kind of crisis,
            largely in part due to the lack of news coverage of the issues
            plaguing India.

            The <b>Calendar of Conflict</b> attempts to show the issues India
            faces with an analytical study of news, highlighting certain events
            and putting into context the news we read. This project uses a
            year’s worth of news from 2019 from a largely neutral source, The
            Hindu to study India from 2019.
          </p>
          <p>
            The idea of a year’s worth of news is very interesting. Akin to an
            ice core, it traps with it all the happenings and events from the
            year. It encapsulates the language, movements, struggles, and the
            mood of the nation within it. Just like an ice core, studying this
            slice of history can be very useful in understanding the nation
            itself.

            In order to analyse the news, I first had to get my hands on a high
            quality dataset.
            <a href="http://thehindu.com" target="_blank">The Hindu</a> is
            considered to be largely neutral/leaning left media house, and is
            known to be of a good editorial standard. I wrote a custom Python
            script to scrape the archival section of the website which gave me a
            list links to every article published in 2019. I then wrote another
            Python script to visit each of their links to scrape the Headline,
            Location, Date, and the News Article itself. This process took about
            13 hours, and the resultant dataset (CSV format) contained around
            <b>167700 lines</b> of data, about <b>245.7MB</b> in size. This was
            a sizable dataset, and was relatively clean. However it is difficult
            to work with a dataset of this size, especially when using a mobile
            computer. Text data processing is a highly CPU intensive task, and
            more the physical cores, the faster the computation.
          </p>
          <p>
            I used <b>Orange3</b>, an open-source software to conduct Sentiment
            Analysis using the Liu Hu process sourced from NLTK. This analysed
            the main article itself and produced a score which reflects how
            positive or negative the content is. The Sentiment Analysis is one
            way to quickly see the ‘mood’ of the news, especially when
            visualised with a heat map. I took this dataset and used Excel to
            search for keywords which reflects conflict, such as “Protest”,
            “Riots”, “Lynch”, “Clash”, and “Strike” amongst others. I also
            looked up keywords such as “Starve”, “Abuse” and “Deforest” to find
            other kinds of conflict. On detecting the presence of the particular
            keyword within the main article, an Excel macro would insert the
            specific keyword it finds in a new column. These keywords would be
            the identifiers and tags for each row.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>
            The processing and tagging of text took a fair bit of time due to
            the size of the dataset. The size of the dataset was a consistent
            barrier in trying to work with it, which reduced the scope of my
            explorations with it. To make it easier to work with the dataset, I
            deleted the main news article itself, which reduced the size of the
            dataset from 245.7MB to 16.9MB. I used <b>d3js</b> and
            <b>p5js</b> to read the data and visualise the sentiment analysis
            and the conflict tagging. The resulting images show how many
            instances of conflict there really are on any given day.
          </p>
          <p>
            The various keywords of conflict have been grouped into larger types
            of conflict, such as interpersonal, political, and environmental, to
            facilitate easier navigation of the news. Some keywords such as
            caste have been included, which show a lack of coverage on caste
            based conflict within the country. This project will have keywords
            and identifiers continuously added to it with time, to make it more
            accurate and informative. The intent is to visualise the news to
            observe patterns, and gain insight about the coverage of different
            kinds of conflict.

            This project first started off with the intent to study the media
            coverage around divisive events in the country, such as the protests
            against the Citizen Amendment Act and the subsequent Delhi Pogroms.
            However, a brief research into the topic raised many more questions
            than it answered. The Modi-led government has deepened the
            Right-Left divide in India and this divide has only deepened with
            the proliferation of the internet and smartphones across India. The
            advent of state controlled media, and media outlets sympathetic to
            the cause of the Hindu nationalists have sowed the seeds of disunity
            amongst communities and families. The rise in the unchecked spread
            of fake news through social media has blurred the line between fact
            and fiction. The BJP has spent an exorbitant amount of taxpayer
            money on using propaganda to sway uninformed and illiterate voters.
            One on occasion, a virtual rally with the help of 70,000 flat screen
            TV’s was held in areas of West Bengal devastated by Cyclone Amphan
            in the middle of global pandemic. The question of identifying what
            is right and wrong is now more important than ever.

            A year’s worth of news also serves as an annual report card, which
            tells the story of how the country is performing. In a media
            landscape devastated by biased media coverage and the lack of
            neutral and analytical reporting, a data-driven look into India can
            serve as a useful indicator of what happened during the year.
          </p>
          <p>
            It’s important to point out that everyone is a victim of poor news
            coverage and improper journalism. Those who have the time,
            knowledge, and privilege to pay for good journalism and fact-check
            their news are only slightly better off. The Calendar of Conflict is
            a data-driven recap of the past that hopes to recontextualise news
            and help us understand the state of the country.
