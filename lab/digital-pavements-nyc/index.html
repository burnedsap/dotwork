            Pavements and curbsides are just of the most vibrant exciting places
            in the city, they are also some of the most versatile spaces in a
            city. They change with the times, adapting to the city’s needs. This
            affordability was on display during the COVID-19 pandemic, during
            which pavements were heavily used as active public spaces to
            socialise and conduct business. To help re-imagine what curbs and
            pavements can look like, multiple spaces around the city will be
            digitally captured and be used to digitally sketch out ideas and
            concepts.

            Social Pavements explores the idea of making the pavements more like
            our homes. Just as we'd like to have our homes be welcoming and
            comfortable, pavements too should be nice places to spend time in.

            So why not place furniture on the pavements to create small meeting
            spaces? We walk far too quickly in the city as it is to notice our
            surroundings. It would do us good to slow down once in a while and
            'see' our city for once.

            Sidewalks are used everyday to get to places, so why not bring
            places to the sidewalks? This concept looks to bring art to the
            pavements. Inspired by the BMW art cars, the intent is to make the
            spaces we walk through a more interesting, and thought provoking
            place.

            Of the many things that New York can have more of, nature is one of
            them. We can never have too many plants or water bodies. This
            concept looks to create sidewalks with lots of plants, trees and
            water bodies. It is difficult to find hygienic sources of clean
            drinking water in the city, and a drinking water fountain is always
            welcome in the city. Cecile also made an observation that the
            corners of the sidewalk facing an intersection are dangerous places.
            There have been instances of drivers losing control, sometimes with
            fatal consequences. She proposes shifting the pedestrian crossing
            inwards, leaving the street facing corners free to become spaces to
            install water fountains and gardens.

            As blessed New York is with it’s nightlife, sometimes you just need
            spaces to party impromptu, or just live in the moment. This concept
            proposes the creation of small dance spaces on the streets, below
            streetlamps. Replete with neon lights, spotlights and speakers,
            these spaces will breed an active street nightlife of the city.

            The 3D models were scanned using 3D Live Scanner, an ARCore powered
            3D scanning app, which were then edited and augmented within
