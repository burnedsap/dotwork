			<p>The Goa Heritage Project is a year long project funded by the British Council and the Prince Claus
				Fund to document and disseminate Goan heritage and culture through emergent art and technology
				platforms such as immersive media, video games and smartphone experiences.

				Our intention is to create and share a sustainable repository of digital heritage prototypes that
				are ripe for further development and incubation in partnership with the people and institutions of
				Goa.</p>

			<p>Initial research started with a deep-dive into the world of Goan crafts. The research on Goan crafts
				led to the idea of using mediums such as Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality to document and
				disseminate the heritage and culture of Goa.

				The next step was to further understand the capabilities of the mediums we would be working with,
				and exploring the possibilities of what could be created. An in-depth exploration of the mediums was
				carried out, to understand the workflow of not only documenting and digitising physical artefacts,
				but also creating immersive and interactive outputs for our target audience to engage with. During
				this stage, the the process of photogrammetry was discovered, which was quickly mastered and a few
				sample outputs were created through which the workflow was tested.</p>

			<p>We also realised that mediums such as Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality were not ideal for all
				project outputs, and simpler mediums such as comics, films, mobile apps and music videos. Although
				Extended Reality Mediums of Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality did have their place, it was
				important to recognise that all mediums have a particular time and place for their ideal use.</p>

			<p>One of the key aspects of our research stage was to build new relationships and leverage existing
				partnerships. We realised that it was very important to have local experts inform the content and
				direction of our projects. These partners would also ensure that the project we collaboratively work
				on would have an audience, or a conduit through which to reach the audience through.

				Although not all collaborations directly led to a project output, the conversations and work from
				those relationships either contributed to some existing projects, or led to the creation of
				tangential projects through which we acquired further funding to continue work on specific
				inquiries.</p>
