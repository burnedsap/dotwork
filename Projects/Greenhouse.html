			<p>This is a project of many parts. From the very outset, it should be said that this isn’t a regular
				design project with a problem and a solution. This is perhaps a research project of sorts, which
				explores the possibilities
				of the future of design practices. Neither
				of these individual projects reaches an endpoint or concludes. It does, however, explore the various
				possibilities, and gives an idea of the potential. New domains are explored, skills learnt, and
				novel possibilities are investigated. It’s not about the end product, but rather what happens along
				the long winding journey that takes you there. The explorations, and learning along that path is
				what makes up the bulk of
				this project. Although the aim is to always make something tangible, something that can be used by
				others, it wasn’t possible to do so in this project. This project was was designated to be a
				research exercise, and by having explored so many options, concrete conclusions can be stated. But
				having the approach to create something substantial did push the project to at least knock on the
				door of completion.</p>

				<p>First, the domain of toolkits are scrutinised, and the process of their making is broken down and
					inspected. Along the path
					of creating a toolkit for helping foster collaboration, the very premise, the very idea of a toolkit
					is gutted and dissected. New formats of information dissemination
					are explored, and the concept of a novel new approach is explored. Although the final product
					doesn’t exist, a prototype is explored.</p>

			<p>Following the the collaboration toolkit, the second part of the project explores the possibility of
				creating a space derived from the insights of the research. The brief does change a few times, and
				the final outcome may not have been completely faithful to the initial proposal, but new grounds are
				explored. The unexplored realm of Virtual Reality is traversed, and with it, the process, and the
				pipeline of creating in this new medium. </p>

			<p>It’s important to look at this project as speculative, research-based project that gets some
				resolution and completion.
				In retrospect, this project is perhaps an instigation to explore the ideas of what
				the future of collaboration holds, both of the framework, and the spaces it might be practised in.
				The project also spawned a new source of funding for the studio along it’s journey, which goes to
				show that even hard research makes for a credible output.</p>
