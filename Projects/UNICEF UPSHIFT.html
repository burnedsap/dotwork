			<p>UPSHIFT is a youth social innovation and social entrepreneurship programme, designed to build skills and
				opportunities for young people who are disadvantaged, due to (for example) poverty, gender, disability
				or ethnicity. The programme empowers young people with the skills and resources they need to identify
				problems in their own communities and design solutions for them.</p>
			<p>The UPSHIFT programme was started by UNICEF Kosovo, and it was very successful. UNICEF in Tajikistan too
				wanted to start their own UPSHIFT programme, and Quicksand was called in to help design the programme
				and facilitate the bootcamps. In the two weeks that the Quicksand team was in Dushanbe, we helped refine
				the human centered design methodology and design a bootcamp agenda which could subsequently be used by
				the UNICEF team to conduct further workshops.</p>
