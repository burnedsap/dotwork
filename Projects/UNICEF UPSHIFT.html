				<p>The UPSHIFT programme was started by UNICEF Kosovo, and it was very successful. UNICEF in Tajikistan too wanted to start their own UPSHIFT programme, and Quicksand was called in to help design the programme and facilitate the bootcamps. In the two weeks that the Quicksand team was in Dushanbe, we helped refine the human centered design methodology and design a bootcamp agenda which could subsequently be used by the UNICEF team to conduct further workshops.</p>

				<p>Quicksand conducted a week-long Training of Trainers bootcamp with selected mentors from around Tajikistan. These mentors would then go on to facilitate UPSHIFT programmes in their communities. We also oversaw one UPSHIFT bootcamp conducted by the mentors in Dushanbe.  </p>
