			<p>The UnBox Caravan is a breakaway festival of the UnBox Festival, one of India’s few design festivals.
				The Caravan, supported by the Mozilla Foundation, brought together designers, technologists, digital
				activists, creative coders and craftspeople for two weeks in Ahmedabad. The senior Product Design
				and Exhibition Design batches worked together with the professional to learn how to work with
				Internet of Things (IoT) devices and create installations which would be exhibited at the
				Conflictorium, a museum which explores human conflicts. </p>

			<p>The theme of the two weeks was Connecting Pols. Pols are traditional community housing units, which
				make up large parts of the old city of Ahmedabad. The Conflictorium museum lies in the centre of the
				old city of Ahmedabad. What makes this museum particularly interesting is that it lies in the
				confluence of five communities, and none of these communities get along with each other. Ahmedabad
				has had a turbulent history in the past, with the memories of the Godhra Riots of 2002 still fresh.
				Communal violence is a delicate subject in the city, and an almost uneasy peace tends to exist among
				the various communities. Although the people of Ahmedabad usually get along, and are a peace-loving
				people, the political tensions are what usually rifts between communities. </p>

			<p>We wanted to try and design an experience which could, if only for a moment masks these tensions, and
				get people to come together and enjoy their time together, however brief it may be for. The idea was
				simple. We wanted to get the children of these five communities to come together and interact with
				each other, for a brief moment. The children of these communities were discouraged from interacting
				with each other by their parents, and often led disparate lives, even though they were neighbours.
				We created a simple installation which would produce bubbles, yes, soap bubbles every time the
				viewers would interact with each other.</p>

			<p>To accomplish this, we created a simple bubble making machine attached to two foil balls. When the
				children would hold the foil balls and hold each others hands to complete the circuit, the bubble
				making machine would spin up and start creating bubbles! If any person broke the connection, the
				bubbles would stop. We weren’t sure if this would work, or if this would have any sort of impact.
				But to our surprise, we had children coming in by droves to see our installation and play with the
				bubbles. When they figured out that they had to hold hands to enjoy the bubbles, they started
				communicating, and interacting with one another to ensure the bubbles would keep coming. We saw some
				moments through day where the children worked together for those brief moments, before dispersing
				and going their separate ways. </p>

			<p>A crash course in working with IoT and electronics quickly evolved into bubbles. The goal was to use
				our new tools to find ways to make an intervention in the community. Using quick and dirty
				prototypes we thought of an installation which would only activate when everyone would hold hands.
				The human circuit would then switch on the installations. Presenting the installations to children
				from deeply divided communities posed a challenge. To unite them, we got the children to hold hands
				with each other which would then activate the installations to produce bubbles! The kids, forgetting
				community divides, even for that brief moment, communicated and helped each other to hold hands to
				enjoy the bubbles. </p>
