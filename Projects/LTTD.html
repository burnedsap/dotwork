				<p>An increasing number of young people are turning to digital mediums for information, entertainment and networking.
				In the ASRH sector too, adoption of digital technologies
				is gaining momentum. Therefore, it is fast becoming an imperative for the sector to develop standards and guidelines for designing, managing and evaluating interventions that leverage these technologies to achieve their outcomes.</p>
				<p>This project seeks to arrive at a prototype of a framework that can be used to plan, implement and evaluate digital-platform based interventions designed to aid Adolescent Sexual and Reproductive Health outcomes (ASRH). These include improved knowledge, reduced teenage pregnancies, a drop in Sexually Transmitted Infections, increased consumption of
				SRH services by the adolescents and a change in their behavior towards sexual and reproductive health.  </p>

				<p>The absence of definitive data on what works to ensure healthy childhood-to-adulthood transitions poses a challenge in developing policies and program interventions that can lead to holistic development. The Population Council
				has responded to these gaps through a research project, ‘Understanding the lives of adolescents and young adults’, Project UDAYA, in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. Insights from
				the UDAYA study show that a growing number of programs and interventions are using Information and Communication Technology (ICT) to reach and engage with adolescents, and to build their knowledge and awareness on pertinent issues.</p>
				
				<p>A sector where this medium has been especially salient has been Adolescent Sexual and Reproductive Health (ASRH). In India’s context, where adolescent sexuality is taboo, digital media and communication has allowed for innovative programming that circumvent challenges of social stigma, judgment and bias to reach adolescents in a safe and private manner. However, many such interventions lack rigorous monitoring and evaluation, which gives rise to the need for more clarity on the impact such programs can potentially have, and the strategies that can optimize this impact.</p>
				<p>This project was conceptualized to address gaps such as these. It seeks to understand the overall landscape of ASRH programming through digital media and ICT in India, identify strengths and weaknesses in these approaches, and suggest a framework and tools that could enhance the effectiveness of these interventions across their lifetimes.</p>
				
				<p>The Quicksand team, along with collaborations
				with experts from various fields, and an Impact Lab engaged in researching three organisations that had taken the digital route in their ASRH program journey. Quicksand’s role was to gather learnings from the experiences of the three organizations along with learnings from the commercial sector and facilitate a conversation around key emergent themes between the stakeholders so as to compile a draft framework.
				</p>
				<p>
					The three organizations that were researched were chosen chosen to bring a representative mix of technology, scale
					of intervention, duration of intervention, and the locational context. The scope of the study limited the research to these three platforms.
