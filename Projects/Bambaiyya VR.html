			<p>In this day and age, we are always running around doing something or the other. But sometimes when we
				pause and notice the world around us, we are suddenly pulled into this vacuum were we feel empty and
				question the meaning of our existence. We find it very difficult to escape that vacuum with a
				logical reasoning. That is partially due to this massive disconnect we have with our roots; with our
				culture.
				In this hyper commercial world we are not aware of what makes us “US” and how are we connected to
				the people and places around us.
				To find ourselves we need to journey inwards and replenish this cultural draught that has been going
				on for generations under the pretext of development and modernisation.</p>

			<p>Bambaiyya VR is funded by The Contemporary Take, Beyond Cultural Heritage Programme by the Prince

			<p>The core idea behind the narrative for Bambaiyya VR is the documentation of unique spaces in Mumbai
				that have stood the test of time but are now fading away due to rapid urbanisation. Tradition and
				culture make a place unique and interesting to live amidst. They should play a vital role in the
				redevelopment of a city. Unfortunately, in most cases these have been neglected. Cities are losing
				their essence and are turning into concrete jungles. We want to capture places in Mumbai that were
				once iconic in their prime but have now turned into a blur as the city moves on.
				Culture and traditions add so much of flavour to our everyday life in the form of festivals, food
				and colour. It pumps vibrancy into an otherwise monotonous lifestyle and also bridges generations by
				giving a topic to talk about. Culture and traditions can leave you with a richer and wholesome
				experience that is lacking in today pseudo society. This journey back in time will help you
				build/find a route to a more fulfilling future.</p>

			<p>During our research, we also started our pre-production. To create a VR film we needed media assets,
				which would be the building blocks of the film.
				Our lead artist, Archit Vaze drew the illustrated environments you see in virtual reality.
				To complement the illustrated worlds, we used a new and nascent process of Photogrammetry to
				digitally scan objects and use them in the VR experience. Photogrammetry is the use of photography
				to ascertain measurements between objects. It is the act of taking many photos of an object and
				calculating distances and angles to form a 3 dimensional model. This process is simple, yet yields
				accurate 3D geometry and high fidelity textures.</p>

			<p>To build on the narrative of the city, the first task was to collect to talk to people and understand
				the heritage and culture of Mumbai.
				The research for Bambaiyya VR has underwent three phases.
			</p>
			<p>First: Finding out intriguing narratives that people
				must have overlooked, oral folk narratives that are very peculiar to specific communities, visual
				references of these narratives and spaces occupied by the communities became the major step to get a
				better understanding
				of the city. This process got us in contact with a few communities of the city namely, Koli,
				Bhandaris
				Pathare Prabhus, Jains & Marwaris, Muslims, Parsis, Christians, Marathas, Mill workers, South
				Indians, Bene Israelis etc. All of these communities have contributed in their on ways to build the
				city as we see it today. The VR experience that would be created would be a collection of the
				various spaces that belong to them along with the oral narratives specific to these communities.</p>

				the original inhabitants, who provided their land to build Mumbai Parsi Community, the immigrants,

				Community, the labourers, who provided their skill and hard work in the various industries to build
